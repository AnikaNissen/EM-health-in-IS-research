This study developed a research model based on the value-based adoption model to understand the factors influencing health care professionals’ adoption of MPMSC. Empirical analysis has shown that perceived value and legal concerns can predict health care professionals’ intention to adopt MPMSC and that outcome expectations, perceived mobility, perceived effort, and privacy concerns can predict perceived value. Research findings can enhance the understanding of the factors influencing the adoption of MPMSC by health care professionals. © 2023 Elsevier B.V."

It employs Toulmin's argument model to develop argument maps that depict the structure of argumentation that took place during the development and implementation of an interorganizational health information exchange initiative (HIE) that took place in southeast USA. Toulmin's argument model faciliated the portrayal of frame salience in terms of three structural properties (i.e., blindness, indifference, and ownership). The study used these properties to show how the breadth, depth and conspicuity of frame structures changed during the course of the project and demonstrated how these changes impacted both the level of contestation observed in the project as well as project outcomes. In addition to lending insights that are specific to this case, our conceptualization of frame structure lends itself to cross-case comparisons and future theory building as the impact of these argument structures can be evaluated in a multitude of different contexts. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

The ability of these agents to accomplish a variety of sequential and related tasks within a single application software has made them more effortful and complex. While effort requirements and complexity of information systems are generally considered negative attributes, the potential effect of user effort investment on user perceptions and decisions is less investigated. Within the framework of goal systems theory, this study explores how perceived effort could be appropriated to enhance users' positive perceptions and willingness to accept healthcare DBAs outputs. We find evidence for the positive role both in the perceived effort before and after the actual use of healthcare DBAs as well as in user goal magnitude and means-goal configuration on perceptions of usefulness and probability of considering outputs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V."

The nursing literature suggests that continuity of care helps reduce medical errors and readmissions and increases patient satisfaction. Balancing patient assignments to nursing staff is also critical to avoid overwork and burnout. This study investigates the relationship between continuity of care and workload balance in NPA decisions in hospital inpatient units. We develop an NPA heuristic to guide continuity-care assignment while addressing the trade-off with workload balance. The heuristic prioritizes higher-acuity patients to the objective of continuity of care, while assignment of lower acuity patients seeks to minimize workload imbalance. A discrete event simulation model of an inpatient hospital unit is used to evaluate how the heuristic addresses the tradeoff between the two objectives under distinct work design scenarios. The heuristic enables significant increases in continuity of care for specific patient segments while limiting the impact on workload balance. We discuss implications for theory and managerial practice. © 2023 Elsevier B.V."

We show how data governance unfolds over time as data become shared and itinerant across multiple actors. Building on our findings, we introduce the concept of data governance spaces to refer to the authorized relationships among multiple actors, which specify the boundaries of decision-making authority, rights, roles, and responsibilities around data processing. We contribute to the literature on data governance by distinguishing between a) authority multiplication, where data are handed over to other actors to serve diverse purposes triggering horizontal dynamics, and b) actor subordination, where authorities delegate data handling for uniform purposes triggering vertical dynamics. Overall, the paper extends prior research by showing how data governance unfolds beyond intra-, or inter-organizational boundaries and shifts attention to data's pivotal role, and the purposes for which data are collected, shared or used across multiple actors. © 2023 The Authors"

As a digital platform that enables healthcare providers to exchange protected health information (PHI), a health information exchange (HIE) is governed by health information privacy regulations. The challenge for HIEs is to operate in a way that will maximize information exchange while maintaining compliance with regulations that may constrain the sharing of PHI. Regulations impose a measure of universality through compliance requirements, while being flexible to allow adaptation to the local context. However, our longitudinal case study into the privacy policies of an HIE, demonstrates that the journey of privacy ideas from their original formulation in regulations, to their ultimate enactment in an organizational setting, is accompanied by translations, such that the final implementation may vary extensively from its original form. Such variability often results in interpretations that differ from what the regulators intended. Consequently, translation guardrails are necessary to protect against problematic translations of regulatory ideas which could lead to compliance issues and loss of platform participation. Our findings offer two contributions. First, we contribute to the compliance literature by explaining how guardrails can balance the use of permission and obligation schemas which are necessary to translate regulations into effective organizational policies for the success of HIEs and other information exchange platforms. Second, we contribute to extending translation theory by explaining how pragmatic reasoning schemas function as the mechanism through which translation of regulations occurs. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

Organizations use these data to run technologies such as smart assistants, augmented reality, and robotics. Most often, these organizations seek to make a profit. Individuals can, however, also provide personal data to public databases that enable nonprofit organizations to promote social welfare if sufficient data are contributed. Regulators have therefore called for efficient ways to help the public collectively benefit from its own data. By implementing an online experiment among 1696 US citizens, we find that individuals would donate their data even when at risk of getting leaked. The willingness to provide personal data depends on the perceived risk level of a data leak but not on a realistic impact of the data on social welfare. Individuals are less willing to donate their data to the private industry than to academia or the government. Finally, individuals are not sensitive to whether the data are processed by a human-supervised or a self-learning smart assistant. © 2023 The Authors"

In this paper, the adequacy of the available information on PRWs is investigated. An empirical study is conducted to understand the information that patients seek from PRWs through a survey instrument administered to 344 patients. A topic modelling approach is then employed on 666,551 text reviews of patients using data from a popular PRW in India to discover information available on the PRWs. Combining both approaches, it is found that 12 out of 25 topics are either unavailable or only partially available, indicating an information gap. Two topics which constitute the information gap are then utilised to conduct a full factorial experiment on 153 respondents using a Latin Square design. Experimental results demonstrate that adding relevant information improves the physician selection process. Our work contributes to the healthcare IS literature on online physician selection and the role of information availability. The results will help PRWs and hospitals decide how to restructure information on their websites and devise strategies to nudge patients to write reviews highlighting the desired information. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."

However, the inequal ability of older adults to use HIT may limit their exploitation of these benefits. To narrow the age-based “digital divide”, this research further develops the concept of digital capability and emphasises the link between older adults and their social context. Based on a qualitative inductive study of 33 participants, who included Chinese patients and their family members, we generate a novel theoretical model for understanding the process by which social activities may shape older adults' digital capabilities. Based on the model, we suggest two strategies that might encourage older adults to engage with HIT. This research contributes to the information systems (IS) literature by strengthening digital capability as a conceptual lens to investigate individuals' engagement with information communication technologies (ICTs). It also extends research on the social context for ICT use by revealing how social processes at multiple levels influence digital capability development. Finally, this study offers practical implications for governments and private sectors to encourage and promote ICT use by older adults. © 2022 The Authors.

To support decision-makers with timely information, we utilize data from online social networks to propose an adaptable information extraction solution to create indices helping to forecast COVID-19 case numbers and hospitalization rates. We show that combining heterogeneous data sources like Twitter and Reddit can leverage these sources' inherent complementarity and yield better predictions than those using a single data source alone. We further show that the predictions run ahead of the official COVID-19 incidences by up to 14 days. Additionally, we highlight the importance of model adjustments whenever new information becomes available or the underlying data changes by observing distinct changes in the presence of specific symptoms on Reddit. © 2023 Elsevier B.V."

Of particular interest is identifying a set of features that can better predict the risk of unplanned readmissions of chronically ill patients within 30 days post discharge, among them patients with Congestive Heart Failure (CHF). While numerous studies have employed ML algorithms to identify sets of significant features, only a handful have compared features extracted by various methods, and even fewer have compared the predictive power of feature sets selected by human experts to those selected by ML. Hence, this research aimed to elicit a comprehensive feature set selected by four ML algorithms and compare its predictive performance to that of a feature set selected by experts. We then evaluated a merged list of the two feature sets, constructing a human-machine collaborative set to predict the likelihood of 30-day unplanned readmission of CHF patients using data on 10,763 CHF patients hospitalized during the years 2010–2017. Our models achieved Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) above 0.8 and an Accuracy of ∼0.89, comparable to the best models in the extant literature. Moreover, the Human-Machine Collaborative model significantly outperformed (best AUC 0.836) other human-only selected models as well as the machine-selected set.

They have the potential to reduce dependency on traditional health information channels, increase health literacy and empower a broader range of individuals in relation to their health management decisions. Successful communities are characterized by high levels of trust in user-generated contributions, which is reflected in increased engagement and expressed through knowledge adoption and knowledge contribution. However, research shows that the majority of OHCs are composed of passive participants who do not contribute via posts, thereby threatening the sustainability of many communities and their potential for empowerment. Despite this fact, the relationship between trust and engagement, specifically the trust antecedents that influence engagement in the OHC community context has not been adequately explained in past research. In this study, we leverage social capital behavior and social exchange theory frameworks in order to provide a more granular trust-based elucidation of the factors that influence individuals’ engagement in OHCs. We collected data from 410 Brazilian participants of Facebook OHCs and tested the research model using partial least squares. The results confirm two new constructs—online community responsiveness and community support—as trust antecedents that influence engagement in OHCs, resulting in knowledge adoption and knowledge contribution responses.

In this paper, we draw on de Vaujany et al.’s framework for organizational IT-based regulation systems to consider how systems operate in open and distributed contexts in which actors have strong agency and regulation is indirect and voluntary. To do so, we consider how IT artifacts become embedded in practices, how data are implicated in regulatory feedback loops, and how individual, organizational and technological actors are mobilized and with what regulatory outcomes. We develop an instrumental case study as a vignette of five regulatory episodes (continuous glucose monitoring systems used by persons with diabetes) to examine how expert rules materialized in mobile health apps, data about bodily states, and IT features such as displays and alarms “nudge” individuals towards compliance with self-regulatory guidelines and practices. Through this analysis, we identify two related regulatory affordances of mobile health apps for predicting and surveilling personal health. We theorize how multilevel networks composed of trifecta of rules, IT artifacts, and practices develop as a regulatory lattice through which social regulation is realized.

This paper is one of the first to empirically investigate the double-edged role of P4P schemes in HIT adoption. We leverage a natural experiment in the US healthcare system, which introduced P4P schemes in 2013.

The blockchain is a data store designed to promote data privacy, as well as transaction integrity. Enterprises in several industries, especially banking, have investigated the implementation of blockchain-based databases to replace centralised databases as one mechanism for protecting customers’ data by separating transactional data from personally identifiable information. Despite the blockchain’s privacy protections, consumers remain largely unaware of these benefits. Building on the Health Belief Model (HBM), we include privacy concerns and inertia as critical factors that influence consumers’ perceptions of blockchain-based databases’ benefits. Using a sample of 304 respondents, we test a theoretical model incorporating these factors. Our study results indicate threat severity, threat susceptibility, awareness, and inertia significantly influence the perceived benefits of blockchain, which has a significant positive influence on consumers’ intention to switch to blockchain-based applications. Although consumers’ comfort with the status quo of traditional banking mechanisms is a significant barrier to the realisation of blockchain banking applications benefits, additional awareness of consumer privacy protections can persuade customers to use the blockchain-based applications, especially if they exhibit heightened privacy concerns. © Operational Research Society 2021."

We provide answers to the following research questions: (1) For whom does the DIY approach work in the context of assistive technology? (2) Under which circumstances do DIY work? and (3) How can researchers make DIY a satisfying experience? The evidence we collected during the “iCare” project suggests that DIY attracts both, elderly people with a need-based motive and a hedonic motive.

Nurses, therefore, encounter a range of stressful situations and events related to using EMR systems, a phenomenon known as technostress. Previous research suggests that individuals appraise technostress differently. However, not much is known about the appraisal process of technostress. By integrating the literature on technostress, affordances, and appraisal theory, this paper introduces the appraisal theory of technostress, which is developed empirically through an interpretive case study involving interviews with hospital nurses. The appraisal theory of technostress explains how individuals process and appraise information about how to potentially act on technology-related stressful events through a system's features. Information about the event, and information about the action potential afforded by the system's features, is evaluated through an appraisal process that includes three appraisal checks: goal relevance, goal conduciveness, and value compatibility. The appraisal checks verify whether the action possibilities of the system's features align or misalign with an individual's goals and values related to action, and shape how the event and the system's features are appraised as challenge or hindrance techno-stressors. Overall, the study offers a novel theoretical perspective and methodological approach to conceptualizing and investigating technostress. More detailed contributions to research and practice are also discussed. © 2022"

Even those who have not contracted the virus have experienced its far-reaching impacts, particularly on their mental health. The increased incidences of psychological problems, anxiety associated with the infection, social restrictions, economic downturn, etc., are likely to aggravate with the virus spread and leave a longer impact on humankind. These reasons in aggregation have raised concerns on mental health and created a need to identify novel precursors of depression and suicidal tendencies during COVID-19. Identifying factors affecting mental health and causing suicidal ideation is of paramount importance for timely intervention and suicide prevention. This study, thus, bridges this gap by utilizing computational intelligence and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to unveil the factors underlying mental health issues. We observed that the pandemic and subsequent lockdown anxiety emerged as significant factors leading to poor mental health outcomes after the onset of COVID-19. Consistent with previous works, we found that psychological disorders have remained pre-eminent. Interestingly, financial burden was found to cause suicidal ideation before the pandemic, while it led to higher odds of depressive (non-suicidal) thoughts for individuals who lost their jobs.

We utilize a similarity calculation method based on natural language processing (NLP) and text mining to evaluate three dimensions of information timeliness: retrospectiveness, immediateness, and prospectiveness. Public engagement is divided into breadth and depth. The empirical results show that information retrospectiveness is negatively associated with public engagement breadth but positively with depth. Both information immediateness and prospectiveness improved the breadth and depth of public engagement. Interestingly, information richness has a positive moderating effect on the relationships between information retrospectiveness, prospectiveness, and public engagement breadth but no significant effects on immediateness; meanwhile, it has a negative moderating effect on the relationship between retrospectiveness and depth but a positive effect on immediateness, prospectiveness. In the extension analysis, we constructed a supervised NLP model to identify and classify health emergency-related information (epidemic prevention and help-seeking) automatically. We find that public engagement differs in the two emergency-related information categories. The findings can promote a more responsive public health strategy that magnifies the transfer speed for critical information and mitigates the negative impacts of information uncertainty or false information. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."

However, research on how various linguistic characteristics of patients' communication in these communities affect their social support outcomes remains limited. This study performs linguistic profiling on OHC participants based on a large dataset and empirically evaluates how lexical, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic features affect users' communication and social support outcomes. The results show that lexical richness in health-related vocabulary negatively correlates with receiving informational support. The readability and brevity of written texts have positive relationships with incoming social support. Writing longer sentences positively correlates with receiving informational support but negatively correlates with receiving emotional support. Expressing negative sentiment leads to higher chances of receiving both types of social support. The use of terms related to perception and body parts increases the chances of receiving emotional support. The use of terms related to perception words additionally correlates to higher chances of receiving informational support. To receive social supports, being logical in expressions is also critical.

This study presents a methodological framework for clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) through analysis of social network data to distinguish the language usage of individuals with early signs of depression (i.e., contrast language analysis). By analyzing the contrast language patterns of different user groups, we are able to uncover constructive and actionable insights into the pain points and characteristics of users with signs of depression as decision support mechanisms for clinicians during intervention, (early) diagnosis and treatment plans. First, we discover terms that represent contrasting language by analyzing the percentage difference of terms in two user groups, labeled as”depressed” and”non-depressed” for ease of reference. Second, by building topic models based on social network contents, the topic-level contrast features are discovered. Finally, we consider the structure of the social network to discover the network-level contrast features. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we present a case study on early depression detection using a real-world dataset. The proposed framework has methodological contributions in enhancing the features and functionalities of CDSS for clinicians.

Hospitals contracting with Medicare, for instance, are reimbursed for the procedures performed, regardless of the number of days that patients stay in the hospital. This reimbursement structure has incentivized hospitals to use their resources (such as their beds) more efficiently to maximize revenues. One way hospitals can improve bed utilization is by predicting patients’ length of stay (LOS) at the time of admission, the benefits of which extend to employees, communities, and the patients themselves. In this paper, we employ a data analytics approach to develop and test a deep learning neural network to predict LOS for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pneumonia. The theoretical contribution of our effort is that it identifies variables related to patients’ prior admissions as important factors in the prediction of LOS in hospitals, thereby revising the current paradigm in which patients’ medical histories are rarely considered for the prediction of LOS. The methodological contributions of our work include the development of a data engineering methodology to augment the data sets, prediction of LOS as a numerical (rather than a binary) variable, temporal evaluation of the training and validation data sets, and a significant improvement in the accuracy of predicting LOS for COPD and pneumonia inpatients. Our evaluations show that variables related to patients’ previous admissions are the main driver of the deep network's superior performance in predicting the LOS as a numerical variable. Using the assessment criteria introduced in prior studies (i.e., ±2 days and ±3 days tolerance), our models are able to predict the length of hospital stay with 86 % and 91 % accuracy for the COPD data set, and with 74 % and 85 % accuracy for the pneumonia data set. Hence, our effort could help hospitals serve a larger number of patients with a fixed amount of resources, thereby reducing their environmental footprint while increasing their revenue, as well as their patients’ satisfaction. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."

With remote diagnosis and treatment capability, teleconsultations have been proposed as a potential solution to the long-standing social problem of geographic disparity in healthcare. Although this sounds promising, unforeseen frictions could suppress the virtual flow of healthcare. It is unclear, then, whether teleconsultations actually mobilize healthcare to underserved regions. To advance our understanding, we first empirically investigate whether teleconsultations generate a virtual flow of healthcare to mitigate geographic healthcare disparity. Second, we examine whether social, information, and geography frictions are present in the virtual healthcare flow. To this end, we curate unique data capturing regional offline health resources and various regional characteristics and match them with teleconsultation instances over 10 years (2006–2015). Our exponential random graph model analysis provides encouraging empirical evidence that teleconsultations connect physicians in resourceful regions and patients in underserved areas—a desirable direction that can alleviate geographic healthcare disparity. However, we also find that various frictions are present. For instance, social and information frictions, such as cultural and linguistic differences and limited media coverage, suppress the supposedly free flow of teleconsultations across regions. Furthermore, although teleconsultation is anticipated to spark long-distance healthcare, we find that teleconsultations are less likely as the regions between patient and physician become farther apart. We examine two plausible mechanisms that contribute to the observed geography friction: (1) a low-information bandwidth of a teleconsultation channel and (2) the financial constraint of rural patients. Supplementary analyses using granular data (fees, physician ranks, and illness types) provide corroborating evidence for the proposed mechanisms. © 2022 INFORMS"

We observe that efficient ACOs do not make trade-offs with respect to healthcare quality, compared with inefficient ACOs. Furthermore, we observe that hospitals that participated in ACOs, and used IT effectively for care coordination with other providers, exhibited a positive association between efficiency and quality. ACOs with higher levels of meaningful use achievement of health IT demonstrate better patient health outcomes because of greater information integration with other care providers. Our findings imply that value-based incentives alone are not sufficient to resolve trade-offs between healthcare quality and efficiency, and healthcare policy needs to incorporate appropriate incentives to foster effective IT use for health information sharing and care coordination between healthcare providers. © 2021 INFORMS"

However, the consequences of physicians' interactive voices on patients' perception have rarely been explored. This study develops a multistage online interaction model to explore the effects of the key vocal emotional cues of physician voice on patient-perceived satisfaction. We collect data of over 44,000 voice interactions regarding lung disease from 889 physicians on a leading online health platform. By using the theoretical lens of emotional contagion, we find that the voice pitch and intensity of physicians, respectively, positively and negatively affect patient-perceived satisfaction, in turn positively affecting physician economic returns in the postinteraction stage. However, the negative effect of intensity is low for physicians with high recommendation popularity (a factor in the preinteraction stage), suggesting that physician-inherent information has an anchoring effect. These findings not only provide new insights into the literature on online physician–patient interaction by identifying the novel nonverbal cues of physician voice, their consequent effects, and boundary conditions, but also provide decision support for physicians and platform managers. © 2022"

Unfortunately, research on the transformation of communication has produced conflicting results, creating tension regarding its efficacy among healthcare professionals. In this paper, we propose that nurse and physician communication performance mediate the relationship between health IT implementation and patient outcomes. We test the mediating role of communication with a hospital-level data set spanning 2011 through 2015. The specific health information technologies we investigate include EMR documentation, computerized physician order entry (CPOE) systems, clinical decision support (CDS) systems, and health information exchanges (HIE). Our results provide that EMR documentation, CPOE, and HIE directly improve communication between care providers and patients as well as patient outcomes. Further, nurse-patient and physician-patient communication mediates the relationship between health IT implementation and patient outcomes. The mediating effect extends the positive benefits to patient outcomes following technology implementation. We also find that poor communication with patients directly increases mortality, decreases satisfaction, and decreases loyalty. Surprisingly, CDS has a negative relationship on communication and patient outcomes. Our findings contribute to the information systems and healthcare literatures by demonstrating the need to account for the multidimensional nature of healthcare and by providing context for the positive and negative effects previously discovered.

These consequences have led hospitals to attempt to identify high-risk patients with predictive models, but research has rarely focused on survival analysis techniques, model applications, and performance measures. This study establishes the uses of survival models to support managerial decision-making for readmissions. First, machine learning and statistical survival techniques are applied, ten of which have not been used in previous readmission research. Secondly, applications of survival models in a decision support capacity are proposed, relating to intervention targeting, follow-up care customisation, and demand forecasting. Thirdly, performance measures for the proposed applications are determined and used for empirical model assessment. These performance measures have not been applied in previous readmission research. The empirical assessment is based on adult admissions to the Emergency Department of Gold Coast University Hospital (n = 46,659) and Robina Hospital (n = 23,976) in Queensland, Australia. The relevant aspects of performance were determined to be discrimination and calibration, as measured by time-dependent concordance and D-Calibration respectively. A range of discrimination and calibration combinations can be achieved by different models, with the Recursively Imputed Survival Tree, Cox regression, and hybrid Cox-ANN techniques being most promising. Survival approaches linking techniques, proposed applications, and performance measurement should be given greater consideration in future healthcare research and in institutions aiming to manage readmissions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."

It uses data from 214 independent samples reported in 193 articles and 83,619 technology users from 33 countries. The study contributes to the HIT literature by (1) synthesizing the empirical findings on technology acceptance factors and combining them in a comprehensive model, (2) testing the mediating mechanisms of health technology acceptance, and (3) examining contextual differences. The study finds that HIT acceptance depends on various predictors proposed by the technology acceptance model and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology. These factors displayed strong indirect effects through effort expectancy, perceptions of the technology, performance expectancy, and attitudes toward using HIT. Studies overlooking these effects may underestimate the importance of various acceptance factors. Finally, the results suggest that technology acceptance varies across healthcare technologies (remote information systems [IS], wearables), users (staff/patients, age, voluntariness, experience), and locations (hospitals, healthcare systems, life expectancy in country).

To mitigate such delays, researchers proposed the movement of idle ambulances between emergency bases as one of the effective ways to improve the areal coverage of future demands. In this study, we have developed a model-driven decision support system that simultaneously seeks to maximize demand coverage while minimizing travel time by optimally relocating emergency response vehicles. The developed mathematical model partitions and prioritizes demand into four categories and continuously updates them over time. Furthermore, it dynamically calculates the number of coverages in different regions based on the current location of idle ambulances. Also, we developed a real-time risk assessment DSS for recommended relocations, which could be utilized as a reference by the EMS user while implementing suggested relocation decisions. A real case study is used to validate the proposed DSS, and its final output is compared to the existing operational policy. The findings show that the average workload added to each ambulance due to relocations has significantly improved the response time and coverage ratio. Compared to the existing operational policy, the developed decision support system decreased the time to respond to calls, which was deemed to be more than to offsets the increase in travel time due to relocation. Furthermore, the system also reduced the total working time of all ambulances by about 9% per shift. © 2021 Elsevier B.V."

Combining signaling theory and technology frames, we examine if, how, and to what extent IT investments over time shape three facets of reputation: generalized favorability, being known, and being known for something. In accessing healthcare services, most patients are unable to assess a hospital’s quality of care directly. Faced with such information asymmetries, patients tend to consider a hospital’s reputation in the media when making care decisions. Indeed, journalists are well positioned to detect even the weaker quality signals—among which are state-of-the-art IT—that a hospital emits. As information intermediaries, journalists aggregate and interpret IT-related signals against the backdrop of their technology frames, which reflect their expectations of how a modern hospital IT should look. Perceived congruence between their IT-related expectations and observations on the ground is likely to translate into less critical writing about a hospital. We test our theorizing based on a comprehensive panel data set of 152 English hospital organizations spanning five consecutive years of IT investments and subsequent changes in media reputation as reflected in 175,973 articles in English newspapers. We find that investments in IT staff increase the “being known” facet of reputation as evidenced in the volume of media coverage. Investments in IT equipment, in contrast, positively affect a hospital’s general favorability as mirrored in the tenor of its media coverage. Our econometric analysis as well as our complementary content analysis of newspaper articles and follow up interviews with journalists allow us to attribute this effect primarily to more visible IT equipment investments that prompt journalists to write less negatively about a hospital. These findings suggest that investments in IT equipment can buffer hospitals from negative press, thereby helping them to gain and maintain a strong reputation in the media. © 2022 INFORMS"

We emphasize two aspects of HIT use in hospitals. First, we focus on whether HIT applications are used to perform primary or support clinical functions. Contingent on whether the use of HIT applications is for performing only primary functions or both primary and support functions, we conceptualize symbiotic and pooled HIT complementarity, respectively. Second, we focus on whether HIT applications are implemented in the same time period or different time periods. Contingent on this temporal aspect, we conceptualize simultaneous and sequential HIT complementarity, respectively. We collected panel data on HIT implementation, clinical quality, experiential quality, and healthcare cost for 715 hospitals in the United States from four sources. Our results suggest that symbiotic, pooled, simultaneous, and sequential complementarity among HITs impact hospital quality and cost outcomes. Our results further indicate that these complementary effects differ across chronic and acute conditions. We also find that three-way complementarity has significant economic effects on quality and cost. In fact, post hoc analyses indicate that three-way sequential complementarity effects, which have not been previously examined, are particularly significant. This paper contributes to the literature by empirically examining different forms of HIT complementarity in hospitals. Our central message is that when assessing HIT value in hospitals, managers and researchers must pay attention to (1) the clinical functions to which these technologies are applied; (2) the sequence in which these HITs are implemented; and (3) the prevalence of chronic versus acute patients admitted in the hospital. © 2021 INFORMS"

There are no simple heuristic approaches to guide ordering decisions in these situations. In this paper, we introduce two near-optimal heuristics to guide replenishment decisions for the fixed lifetime perishable inventory problem with random transfers. Much like the traditional base stock policy, the heuristics are straightforward to calculate and implement. The first heuristic (H1) employs a base stock policy using the convolution of demand and transfer distributions. The second heuristic (H2) employs a transfer adjusted base stock policy. We validate our heuristics using inventory-related cost components (i.e., order, holding, wastage, and underage costs) and demand and transfer distributions based on data provided by a large university medical center. Via simulation, we evaluate the performance of the heuristics by comparing the total costs obtained using each heuristic to the total costs obtained using the optimal ordering policy. Both heuristics perform quite well. We conduct a variety of sensitivity analyses considering the effects of different (1) levels of holding and stockout costs, as these costs are difficult to quantify and can vary dramatically, and (2) percentile transfer adjustments in H2. We observe that the H1 policy consistently results in slightly larger orders than the optimal policy, which leads to a slightly higher inventory, holding costs and wastage rates, yet slightly lower stockout costs. The H2 policy, on the other hand, consistently results in slightly smaller orders than the optimal policy, which leads to a slightly smaller inventory, lower holding costs and wastage rates, yet slightly higher stockout costs. To guide decision making, we discuss a number of management challenges that we encountered as part of this project and offer a five-step process to help decision makers with replenishment decisions. © 2021"

Using a dataset collected from a leading online fitness brand, we find that both UGC and MGC affect a free fitness video's incremental view count. We further categorize UGC into three dimensions, where favorability represents the normative dimension, various textual features represent the informational dimension, and reply-density of the self-organized reviewer community represents the social dimension. While both normative and social UGC are positively associated with online fitness videos' view count increase, the impact of informational UGC is insignificant. More importantly, product features, such as exercise intensity, moderate the impacts of UGC and MGC on free digital content consumption.

It adopts Bourdieu's social practice theory to examine the interaction of HIT with the reproduction of doctors' historically rooted social standing through the doctor-patient-interaction (D-P-I) practice. Findings from our ethnographic enquiry at a large corporate healthcare organisation in India link doctors' historically rooted social standing to the symbolic recognition of their embodied emotional capital existing in tandem with their habitus. The symbolic recognition of emotional capital provided a better valorisation of clinical capital and allowed the accumulation of other forms of capital—institutionalised capital, social capital and economic capital—that formed doctors' capital structure and contributed to their social status. Doctors produced emotional capital by putting their habitus into practice and, in the process, reproduced its symbolic status and their social status linked to it. HIT challenged doctors to put their habitus into practice, thereby creating a perception of threat to emotional capital. Doctors' HIT resistance was a conservation strategy to reproduce their historically rooted higher social status.

Recently, changes in the nature of technologies used in organizational contexts and changing organizational structures call for a renewed focus on IT championing to explain its distributed nature. Following an analytic induction approach and drawing from semi-structured interviews with 37 practitioners (physicians, residents, nurses, IT staff, and administrators) in three healthcare-related settings, the study conceptualizes distributed IT championing as a process constituted of multiple individuals’ behaviors, unfolding over time, that proactively go beyond formal job requirements in support of an IT implementation. While multiple individuals may enact similar championing behaviors, the data indicate that multiple individuals may also enact distinct, yet complementary, championing behaviors over the course of the IT implementation. Overall, distributed IT championing evolves through cycles of distinct stages of bridging-in, bonding, and bridging-out, with each stage being shaped by different dimensions of social capital. Also, IT artifacts that are particularly generative appear more conducive to distributed IT championing than closed ones.

In the pursuit of operational efficiencies, program administrators often contract with private managed care organizations (MCOs) to procure insurance for beneficiaries. This, however, encourages MCOs to attract the healthiest beneficiaries and avoid the sickest, a phenomenon known as risk selection. This paper investigates whether risk selection can be mitigated with a mechanism where MCOs bid to enroll each individual beneficiary. Although procurement auctions have been studied extensively in the literature, extant research has rarely discussed individual-level bidding. Digitization can contribute to the development and introduction of efficient market structures and mechanisms for matching beneficiaries with appropriate MCOs. We model demand- and supply-side aspects in a two-sided insurance marketplace to examine three mechanisms, risk adjustment, bidding, and a mix of prospective payment and bidding, with and without reserve prices. Analytical results show that traditional risk adjustment cannot optimally be used to eliminate risk selection, whereas the bidding mechanisms eliminate it entirely. Mixed bidding eliminates risk selection at a strictly lower cost than pure bidding. The proposed mixed bidding approach is a new type of mechanism with preauction offers that strictly dominates the second-price auction without requiring additional assumptions. Numerical analysis shows bidding dominates risk adjustment in 75.1% of simulated parameter sets. Compared with risk adjustment, bidding secures coordinated care for 12.1% more allocated beneficiaries while lowering program costs by 9.2% and largely preserving MCO profits. This would amount to approximately $27.2 billion in Medicaid program savings. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the proposed bidding mechanism dominates in scenarios that closely resemble real-world healthcare entitlement environments. These results show that digital markets that enable individual-level auctions are a promising approach for achieving the dual aim of financial sustainability and expanded access to care for the most vulnerable. © 2021 INFORMS."

Previous health information technology (HIT) research has focused on HIT acceptance via information system-related constructs. Theoretical models explaining HIT use are limited and obfuscated other phases of HIT, such as continuous use in a clinical context. This study seeks to fill this gap by integrating context-related factors with IS factors in a theoretical framework that explains the antecedents of continuous use. To validate this model, data were collected from physicians after six months of using CDSS as well as system usage data from system logs. Threats to physician professional identity surpassed the intention to continue using CDSS, influencing its use by physicians in the first six months, and patients affected by the system influenced physician satisfaction with the system and, hence, their use of the system. This study reveals physicians’ continuous use of CDSS and explains the effects of healthcare contexts on physicians’ behaviour. © The Operational Research Society 2022."

However, prior studies suggest that individuals resist such innovative technology. In contrast to prior studies that investigate individuals’ decisions for themselves, we focus on family members’ rejection of AI monitoring, as family members play a significant role in health care decisions. Our research investigates competing effects of emotions toward the rejection of AI monitoring for health care. Based on two scenario-based experiments, our study reveals that emotions play a decisive role in family members’ decision making on behalf of their parents. We find that anxiety about health care monitoring and anxiety about health outcomes reduce the rejection of AI monitoring, whereas surveillance anxiety and delegation anxiety increase rejection. We also find that for individual-level risks, perceived controllability moderates the relationship between surveillance anxiety and the rejection of AI monitoring. We contribute to the theory of Information System rejection by identifying the competing roles of emotions in AI monitoring decision making. We extend the literature on decision making for others by suggesting the influential role of anxiety. We also contribute to healthcare research in Information System by identifying the important role of controllability, a design factor, in AI monitoring rejection. © 2022 The Author(s).

Counterintuitively, we also identify a symbiotic relationship between these two focal and interdependent efforts. We adopt an interpretive qualitative research method leveraging the value-focused thinking (VFT) approach which results in two major contributions: (1) the development of a value-driven framework presented as a means-end objective network providing a list of 16 means objectives and seven key fundamental objectives enabling higher-quality privacy decision making vis-à-vis privacy and utility.

The market for fitness technologies continues to increase, and the technologies themselves are quickly advancing. However, it is unclear how effective fitness technologies are in generating wellness outcomes, and there is concern regarding frequent discontinuance behaviors. Accordingly, we develop a model to explain how the perception that fitness technologies satisfy or frustrate users’ basic psychological needs (BPNs) in exercise mediates the relationships between the users’ goals for fitness technology use and psychological well-being and continuance. We find that users who start using fitness technologies for enjoyment, challenge, revitalization, affiliation, or to make positive improvements to their health or strength and endurance, are more likely to report that the fitness technologies are satisfying their BPNs, whereas users who start using them for stress management, social recognition, competition, or weight management are more likely to report BPNs frustration. Notably, users who start using fitness technologies for enjoyment and to make positive improvements to their health or strength and endurance are less likely to report BPNs frustration, and use driven by social recognition goals can decrease BPNs satisfaction. BPNs satisfaction is associated with both increased psychological well-being and continuance, whereas BPNs frustration is negatively associated with both. Fitness technologies must thus be perceived by users to satisfy their BPNs (i.e., autonomy, competence, and relatedness) in exercise to ensure positive outcomes from use. © 2022 by the Association for Information Systems."

Yet, a minimal amount is understood about whether, how, and why digital games, notably mobile games, might affect mental health, particularly depression. In this work, we examine the effect of location-based mobile gaming on local depression trends. We measure population-level depression using a well-established mechanism from the medical and public health literature, internet search of depression-related terms. We argue that the introduction of Pokémon Go, a mobile game that encourages outdoor physical activity, face-to-face socialization, and exposure to nature, may alleviate non-clinical forms of mild depression for users playing the game. To identify the effect, we employ a difference-in-differences approach to exploit the staggered release of Pokémon Go into 166 regions in 12 English-speaking countries. We empirically document a disproportionate decrease in depression-related search in those regions where users are able to play Pokémon Go. This finding lends credence to anecdotal claims that location-based mobile games may alleviate symptoms of depression of their users, underscoring the mental health opportunities of location-based mobile gaming and creating new opportunities for information systems research. © 2022 The Author(s).

In a region home to more than one billion people yet beset by a paucity of services and infrastructure, mobile devices and platforms are rapidly gaining ground. Rising healthcare needs and costs along with the fact that more than 60% of SSA lives in areas nearly 1.5 miles away from paved roads that lead to hospitals and banks, accessibility to traditional financial services remains a serious concern. As Sub-Saharan hospitals increase billing access via mobile payment platforms, there is little understanding of whether and how mobile payment platforms influence healthcare service quality (HSQ). Drawing upon economic utility and trust perspectives, this study develops an integrative model to examine mobile payment platform utility’s impact on patient trust, commitment, and HSQ perceptions. The model is empirically tested using a survey of 527 patients from the West African country of Nigeria. Results reveal a distinct amalgam of MPP utility, trust, and commitment as antecedents to HSQ perceptions, thus generating important insights and contributing to the ongoing inquiry of how digital platforms in developing countries can influence socio-economic development.

To investigate this dynamic, we build on the notion of data ecosystems and provide empirical evidence from a longitudinal, 15-year case study of the emergence, expansion and eventual collapse of a large-scale data analytics project–called DAMD–in the Danish health care sector. We demonstrate that data reuse in the evolving data ecosystem elicited a data reuse dark side that was so dominant that it eventually resulted in the project’s demise. We conceptualise the reuse dark side’s three major mechanisms as function creep, stakeholder creep and data creep. Based on these insights, we develop an empirically grounded Data Analytics Ecosystem Model that extends the current understanding of data ecosystems and provides a view of these ecosystems as having both a bright and a dark side. © Operational Research Society 2021."

In this study, we interviewed forty-four seniors across North America and collected data from their wearable devices to develop a theoretical affordance network-based model to explain seniors’ effective use of wearable devices. Our model indicates that despite the apparent simplicity of wearable devices, they have multiple affordances that help seniors achieve several goals, including activity monitoring, activity planning, and activity improvement. Furthermore, we identified factors that enable seniors to actualise the affordances of wearable devices and achieve their goals.

We address this gap in the literature by developing and testing hypotheses about substitution and complementarity in physicians’ use of health information exchange (HIE), which merges patient data from multiple sources, following the implementation of a local electronic medical record (EMR) system. The hypotheses are anchored in theories foundational to understanding the motivation for information seeking behaviour. The hypotheses are tested with unique data, recorded in system log files, that describe HIE use by physicians in an emergency department before and after EMR implementation. The findings confirm that system use is characterised by substitution when it is defined dichotomously as whether the system is accessed or not (lower HIE access rates after EMR implementation) and by complementarity when it is defined as the extent of system use (higher volume and duration of HIE use after EMR implementation). Our findings suggest that the information seeking literature has underestimated the explanatory value of the cost-benefit approach and the occurrence of complementarity in system use because of its overreliance on a narrow definition of use. © Operational Research Society 2020."

Compared with rule-based systems, however, these systems are less transparent and their errors less predictable. Much research currently aims to improve AI technologies and debates their societal implications. Surprisingly little effort is spent on understanding the cognitive challenges of decision augmentation with AI-based systems although these systems make it more difficult for decision makers to evaluate the correctness of system advice and to decide whether to reject or accept it. As little is known about the cognitive mechanisms that underlie such evaluations, we take an inductive approach to understand how AI advice influences physicians' decision-making process. We conducted experiments with a total of 68 novice and 12 experienced physicians who diagnosed patient cases with an AI-based system that provided both correct and incorrect advice. Based on qualitative data from think-aloud protocols, interviews, and questionnaires, we elicit five decision-making patterns and develop a process model of medical diagnosis decision augmentation with AI advice. We show that physicians use second-order cognitive processes, namely metacognitions, to monitor and control their reasoning while assessing AI advice. These metacognitions determine whether physicians are able to reap the full benefits of AI or not. Specifically, wrong diagnostic decisions often result from shortcomings in utilizing metacognitions related to decision makers' own reasoning (self-monitoring) and metacognitions related to the AI-based system (system monitoring). As a result, physicians fall for decisions based on beliefs rather than actual data or engage in unsuitably superficial information search. Our findings provide a first perspective on the metacognitive mechanisms that decision makers use to evaluate system advice. Overall, our study sheds light on an overlooked facet of decision augmentation with AI, namely, the crucial role of human actors in compensating for technological errors. Copyright: © 2021 INFORMS"

Such initiatives profoundly influence both providers’ choices in terms of healthcare effort levels and HIE adoption and patients’ choice of providers. Using a game-theoretical model of a healthcare setup, we examine the role of payment models in aligning providers’ and patients’ incentives for realizing socially optimal (i.e., first-best) choices. We show that the traditional fee-for-service (FFS) payment model does not necessarily induce the first-best solution. The pay-for-performance (P4P) model may induce the first-best solution under some conditions if provider switching by patients during a health episode is socially suboptimal, making provider coordination less of an issue. We identify an episode-based payment (EBP) model that can always induce the first-best solution. The proposed EBP model reduces to the P4P model if the P4P model induces the first-best solution. In other cases, the first-best inducing EBP model is multilateral in the sense that the payment to a provider depends not only on the provider’s own efforts and outcomes but also on those of other providers. Furthermore, the payment in this EBP model is sequence dependent in the sense that payment to a provider is contingent upon whether the patient visits a given provider first or second. We show that the proposed EBP model achieves the lowest healthcare cost, not necessarily at the expense of care quality or provider payment, relative to FFS and P4P. Although our proposed contract is complex, it sets an optimality baseline when evaluating simpler contracts and also characterizes aspects of payment that need to be captured for socially desirable actions. We further show that the value of HIEs depends critically on the payment model as well as on the social desirability of patient switching. Under all three payment models, the HIE value is higher when switching by at least some patients is desirable than when switching by any patient is undesirable. Moreover, the HIE value is highest under the FFS model and lowest under the P4P model. Hence, assessing the value of HIEs in isolation from the underlying payment mechanism and patient-switching behavior may result in under- or overestimation of the HIE value. Therefore, as payment models evolve over time, there is a real need to reevaluate the HIE value and the government subsidies that induce providers to adopt HIEs. © 2021 University of Minnesota.

The Activity of Daily Living (ADL) approach is a common means to monitor disease progression and the ability of these individuals to care for themselves. However, the prevailing sensor-based ADL monitoring systems primarily rely on wearable motion sensors, capture insufficient information for accurate ADL recognition, and do not provide a comprehensive understanding of ADLs at different granularities. Current healthcare IS and mobile analytics research focuses on studying the system, device, and provided services, and is in need of an end-to-end solution to comprehensively recognize ADLs based on mobile sensor data. This study adopts the design science paradigm and employs advanced deep learning algorithms to develop a novel hierarchical, multiphase ADL recognition framework to model ADLs at different granularities. We propose a novel 2D interaction kernel for convolutional neural networks to leverage interactions between human and object motion sensors. We rigorously evaluate each proposed module and the entire framework against state-of-the-art benchmarks (e.g., support vector machines, DeepConvLSTM, hidden Markov models, and topic-modeling-based ADLR) on two real-life motion sensor datasets that consist of ADLs at varying granularities: Opportunity and INTER. Results and a case study demonstrate that our framework can recognize ADLs at different levels more accurately. We discuss how stakeholders can further benefit from our proposed framework. Beyond demonstrating practical utility, we discuss contributions to the IS knowledge base for future design science-based cybersecurity, healthcare, and mobile analytics applications. © 2021 University of Minnesota.

Furthermore, we examine how the expectation disconfirmation bias impacts classification performance. Analyzing a large sample of health inspections, corresponding online reviews and restaurant visitor data, we propose and evaluate different predictive models. We find that classifiers specifically taking into account information from online review platforms outperform different baseline approaches. We thus show that online reviews encompass private information indicating strong information efficiency. Furthermore, we observe that the expectation disconfirmation bias has an influence on classification performance in case of restaurants with a low star rating and with a poor inspection history. An ensemble classifier can help to mitigate this influence. Thus, online review platforms contain relevant information to predict future health violations.

Toward that end, prescriptive analytics that analyzes health care data to recommend optimal decisions is both relevant and crucial. We develop a novel prescriptive analytics method to improve the cost effectiveness in clinical decision making (CDM), a critical health care dimension that can greatly benefit from analytics. Effective prescriptive analytics for CDM has to address its probabilistic, cost-sensitive, and investment-related characteristics simultaneously. Unlike existing methods that often overlook the investment-related characteristic, the proposed method accounts for all of these characteristics. Specifically, our method considers two sets of costs associated with clinical decisions - before and after an investment - in combination with the probabilities of cost changes due to the investment. In contrast, prevalent methods only emphasize one set of costs, before an investment. Furthermore, the proposed method involves both clinical and investment decisions, whereas existing methods ignore investment decisions. Empirical evaluations with two real-world clinical data sets indicate that the proposed method consistently and significantly outperforms several salient methods from previous research, thereby demonstrating the value of addressing the investment-related characteristic in efforts to improve CDM. © 2021 University of Minnesota.

Appointment scheduling models typically mitigate the negative effects of no-shows through appointment overbooking. Recent work has proposed a predictive overbooking framework, where a probabilisitic classifier predicts the no-show probability of individual appointment requests, and a scheduling algorithm uses those predictions to optimally schedule appointments. Because predicting no-shows is typically an imbalanced classification problem, the preferred classifier is often chosen based upon the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), which is a commonly used metric for many other imbalanced classification problems. Contrary to intuition, in this paper we show that employing the AUC to select a classifier results in significantly lower schedule efficiency than using other metrics such as Log Loss or Brier Score. Our computational experiments, validated on large real-world appointment data, suggest that by using Log Loss or Brier Score instead of AUC, practitioners can improve the schedule quality by 3–7%. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."

In this paper, we develop a novel model to predict the expected LOS at the time of admission by combining network science and deep learning. We propose a two-dimensional construct of latent comorbidities comprising historical and probable comorbidities that a patient does not currently manifest but could likely develop during the course of hospital stay. The probable comorbidities are derived from a network comprising relationships among diseases observed in 3.2 million patient records in hundreds of US hospitals. We employ this construct of latent comorbidities in deep learning models to predict patients’ LOS using almost 10 million other patient visits belonging to various disease categories. Implementing these models and analyses required a high-performance computing (Big Data) facility. The average mean absolute percent error of our models across all categories of diseases was 29.8%, which is the best in the current state-of-the-art.

First, we theorize the A-G configuration as an intertwined intermediate-scale entity that represents the form of the infrastructure and simultaneously constitutes an assemblage in its own right. Second, we demonstrate how an A-G configuration and its infrastructure coevolved through a series of interacting stabilization and destabilization processes operating within and across levels. Finally, we argue that tensions driving the evolution of infrastructures are also dynamic and that, accordingly, the focus of study should be on the processes of stabilization and destabilization rather than on stability and change themselves. © 2021 by the Association for Information Systems."

We selected MedicineAfrica – a digital platform known for creating social value by providing medical education in regions with under-resourced healthcare systems – and drew on multiple data collection methods. We found that it is through a unique form of digital health activism that social value is created in this context. Drawing on a sociological understanding of digital health activism, we make the following contributions: First, we identify three types of non-economic, social value: cognitive, professional and epistemic. Second, we indicate that social value creation is enabled by three emergent forms of digital health activism (ie, philanthropic, moral and reciprocal activity). Third, we elicit three enabling mechanisms explaining how these forms of activism are technically and socially afforded through the platform's connective capacity and emerging collective practices in tandem with its members' growing commitment.

However, it is far from certain whether patient-generated online reviews accurately reflect the quality of care provided by physicians, especially in the context of chronic disease care. Because chronic diseases require continuous care, monitoring, and multiple treatments over extended time periods, it can be quite hard for patients to assess the effectiveness of a particular physician accurately. Given this credence nature of chronic disease care, the research question is the following: what is the information value associated with online reviews of physicians who treat chronic disease patients? We address this issue by examining the link between online reviews of physicians and their patients’ actual clinical outcomes based on a granular admission–discharge data set. Contrary to popular belief, our study finds that there is no clear relationship between online reviews of physicians and their patients’ clinical outcomes, such as readmission risk or emergency room visits. Our findings have two major implications: (a) online reviews may not be helpful in the context of healthcare services with credence aspects; (b) because treatments of chronic diseases have more credence good characteristics when compared with surgeries or other acute care services, one should not extrapolate research on surgeries and acute care services to chronic disease care. Rather, one should acquire a better understanding of the information conveyed in online reviews regarding a physician’s ability to deliver certain clinical outcomes before drawing inferences.

Accordingly, information security researchers have sought to understand why employees comply with or violate information security policies (ISPs) designed to prevent security incidents. Research suggests that compliance is not uniform but rather depends on contextual and individual factors, such as national culture. Scholars have long recognized that organizational subculture may be equally influential. A key example is professional subcultures, within which members typically share similar education, training, values, and identity. Research shows that behavior can vary widely across professional subcultures, and thus a single approach to promoting ISP compliance may not be equally effective across these subcultures. However, it is presently unclear how subculture influences ISP compliance. To address this need, we adopt a mixed-methods design to examine differences in ISP violation behavior among different professional subcultures in a healthcare organization. We first conducted an exploratory qualitative study to identify different attitudes toward ISP violations among three prominent professional healthcare groups: physicians, nurses, and support staff. Then, using a combination of qualitative interviews, observational fieldwork, and a quantitative survey, we explored how professional group membership moderates (1) the influence of perceptions of sanctions on intentions to violate the ISP and (2) the effect of intentions to violate on actual ISP violation behaviors. Our findings highlight the substantial effect of professional subculture on ISP violations in organizations and provide insights for researchers and managers that may be used to improve overall ISP compliance.

Further, many studies examine ambidexterity approaches individually without considering how different approaches may be combined. To address these shortcomings, we pragmatically examine how a U.S. health delivery organization responded to technological, regulatory, and demand changes over a 15-year period and the effects of its actions. To manage the consequential tensions between innovation and operation of its IT-enabled services, we retrospectively observe that the organization applied a portfolio of sequential, structural, and contextual ambidexterity approaches.

This has triggered large-scale adoption across hospitals. However, whether all hospitals obtain a similar effect from their EHR implementations remains an important question because there are significant differences differences in characteristics of hospitals adopting these systems. To examine differences in effects across hospitals, we examine whether the impacts of EHR applications are contingent on work domains, by assessing performance effects across hospitals with varying administrative scale and clinical complexity. Because EHRs constitute a suite of applications with different functionalities, examining the effects of different sets of applications is challenging due to nonlinear interdependencies between applications. Therefore, we use an archetype approach, identifying synergistic EHR (EHRSYN) archetype as an ideal portfolio—a conceptual anchor for a hospital's EHR portfolio. We test contingencies by combining this technology archetype with the work domains—administrative scale and clinical complexity. We test our hypotheses using empirical data from 137 hospitals in California, hypothesizing the differences in effects of EHRs on financial, operational, and clinical performances across hospitals with different administrative scales (size) and clinical complexities (case-mix) of work. While hospitals gain the most by implementing a portfolio close to the EHRSYN archetype, our nuanced models reveal that the benefits of such portfolios increase for large hospitals and are greater for hospitals treating less complex cases. These findings underscore how variations in applications used and work domains demarcate boundaries related to the performance effects of EHRs.

To address this problem, healthcare managers could aim at improving attendance levels or minimizing the operational impact of no-shows by adapting resource allocation policies. However, given the uncertainty of patient behaviour, generating relevant information regarding no-show probabilities could support the decision-making process for both approaches. In this context many researchers have used multiple regression models to identify patient and appointment characteristics than can be used as good predictors for no-show probabilities. This work develops a Decision Support System (DSS) to support the implementation of strategies to encourage attendance, for a preventive care program targeted at underserved communities in Bogotá, Colombia. Our contribution to literature is threefold. Firstly, we assess the effectiveness of different machine learning approaches to improve the accuracy of regression models. In particular, Random Forest and Neural Networks are used to model the problem accounting for non-linearity and variable interactions. Secondly, we propose a novel use of Layer-wise Relevance Propagation in order to improve the explainability of neural network predictions and obtain insights from the modelling step. Thirdly, we identify variables explaining no-show probabilities in a developing context and study its policy implications and potential for improving healthcare access.

Accordingly, the scope of HHC services is also expanding from typical nursing and postoperative care at home to cover all types of needs of elderly patients (e.g., personal care, drug delivery and meal services). This paper aims to address the pressing demand for HHC services and develop a novel and effective mathematical model and solution methodology for supporting health care service delivery decisions. Our decision support framework captures the real needs of HHC services, including the challenges of creating simultaneous schedules and route plans for a set of HHC staff and Home Delivery Vehicles (HDVs) under the requirements of synchronization between HHC staff and HDVs visits, multiple visits to patients, multiple routes of HDVs and pickup/delivery visits related precedence for HDVs. A Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is developed to characterize the optimization problem. Considering the computational complexity of the problem, a Hybrid Genetic Algorithm (HGA) is proposed to suggest HHC planning decisions. The model formulation and proposed HGA are examined on real-life instances for demonstrating its practicality and randomly generated test instances for assessing the scalability of the proposed approach. The results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our solution methodology. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm provided a good performance even with an increasing number of required synchronized services, whereas the heuristic tactics facilitate the HGA to produce better-quality solutions in a significantly shorter time.

In EHR data, usually, there are millions of patients records with hundreds of features collected over a long period of time. This enormity of EHR data poses significant challenges, one of which is dealing with many variables with very high degrees of missing values. In this study, the data quality issue of incompleteness in EHR data is discussed, and a framework called ‘Missing Care’ is introduced to address this issue. Using Missing Care, researchers will be able to select the most important variables at an acceptable missing values degree to develop predictive models with high predictive power. Moreover, Missing Care is applied to analyze a unique, large EHR data to develop a CDSS for detecting Parkinson's disease. Parkinson is a complex disease, and even a specialist's diagnosis is not without error. Besides, there is a lack of access to specialists in more remote areas, and as a result, about half of the patients with Parkinson's disease in the US remain undiagnosed.

Second, high service quality at the pre- and after-sale stages motivate patients to give material compliments rather than psychological compliments, whereas psychological compliment is more likely to be triggered for high service quality received at the during-sale stage. Third, service quality at one stage enhances the effect of service quality at its subsequent stages on compliments.

Such an understanding can reveal insights into how healthcare is actually delivered to patients through both channels, how to contribute to quantifying the social impacts of online healthcare services (Health 2.0), and how to improve healthcare delivery systems. Thus, in this study, we investigate physicians’ online-offline behavior dynamics using data from both online and offline channels to conduct our analysis. As physicians’ online and offline activities are highly endogenous, we deploy a time-series technique and develop a structural vector autoregression model to examine the behavior dynamics. We find that physicians’ online activities can lead to a higher service quantity in offline channels, whereas offline activities may reduce physicians’ online services because of resource constraints. Our results also show that the more offline patients physicians serve, the more articles the physicians will likely share online. These findings are robust to various econometric specifications and estimation methods. Our research advocates for the benefits Health 2.0 produces and provides evidence of the value of online healthcare communities and the policies that support them. Copyright: © 2020 INFORMS."

We drew on social networks theory in general and social contagion theory in particular, and examined the impact of advice network constructs on ICT kiosk use and the impact of ICT kiosk use on women's health outcomes (i.e., seeking modern medical care and maternal mortality). A two-level model (i.e., village and individual) was developed to understand how women in rural India were influenced by other women in their advice networks to use ICT kiosks, and the effects of ICT kiosk use on seeking modern medical care and maternal mortality. At the village level, we proposed lead user network effects. At the individual level, we proposed structural network effects of other women in a focal woman's network on individual outcomes of ICT kiosk use, seeking modern medical care, and maternal mortality. We focused on network position (i.e., centrality) and network tie strength (i.e., strong ties and weak ties) as explanatory variables. Specifically, we argued that strong tie centrality will have an adverse effect on ICT kiosk use, whereas weak tie centrality will have a favorable effect. We also argued ICT kiosk use will have a positive effect on seeking modern medical care and a negative effect on maternal mortality. Finally, we argued that seeking modern medical care will have a negative effect on maternal mortality. Our model was mostly supported in data collected about 6,710 women in 10 intervention group villages in rural India and 8,344 women in the control group villages over a period of approximately 7 years. © 2020 University of Minnesota.

Frequent hospitalization can be partially attributed to the failure of healthcare providers to engage effectively with their patients. Recently, patient portals have become popular as information technology (IT) platforms that provide patients with online access to their medical records and help them engage effectively with healthcare providers. Despite the popularity of these portals, there is a paucity of research on the impact of patient-provider engagement on patients' health outcomes. Drawing on the theory of effective use, we examine the association between portal use and the incidence of subsequent patient hospitalizations, based on a unique, longitudinal dataset of patients' portal use, across a 12-year period at a large academic medical center in North Texas. Our results indicate that portal use is associated with improvements in patient health outcomes along multiple dimensions, including the frequency of hospital and emergency visits, readmission risk, and length of stay. This is one of the first studies to conduct a large-scale, longitudinal analysis of a health IT system and its effect on individual-level health outcomes. Our results highlight the need for technologies that can improve patient-provider engagement and improve overall health outcomes for chronic disease management. © 2020 University of Minnesota.

Interpretability, however, is often precluded by complex dynamic models that would be capable of capturing the intrapersonal variability of disease trajectories. Therefore, we develop a cross-sectional ARMA model that allows for inference of the expected course of symptoms. Distinct from traditional time series models, it generalizes to cross-sectional settings and thus patient cohorts (i.e., it is estimated to multiple instead of single disease trajectories). Our model is evaluated according to a longitudinal 52-week study involving 928 patients with low back pain. It achieves a favorable prediction performance while maintaining interpretability.

This study proposes a novel BCT-based mHealth App recommendation method to suggest suitable mHealth Apps to users. Specifically, we encode mHealth Apps to obtain information on the BCT adopted by the Apps. Based on the combination of BCTs in each mHealth App and its usage information, we construct a User-BCT matrix to represent users' preferences concerning BCTs. We also construct a user profile for each user, which considers their characteristics related to BCTs. Next, we build a prediction model that links each user's profile to BCTs, and use the AdaBoost algorithm to predict suitable BCTs for a target user. Finally, we recommend mHealth Apps with the highest BCT-matching levels to a target user. We also investigate the performance of the proposed method using a real dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."

First, we demonstrate how clinical managers' perception of their hybrid role in relation to their professional identity influences their response to the conflicting institutional demands of IT innovation.

This study adopts the design science paradigm to develop an innovative deep transfer learning framework for human identification (DTL-HID) to address both challenges. A novel convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to automatically extract comprehensive temporal and cross-axial motion patterns for the DTL-HID framework. We rigorously evaluate the DTL-HID framework against state-of-the-art benchmarks (e.g., k Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, and alternative CNN designs).

We demonstrate a case study and discuss how stakeholders can further apply this approach to unobtrusive smart home monitoring for senior citizens.

The resultant theoretical model explains how influence tactics modulate user perceptions, user resistance to the system, and ultimately the unfaithful use of the system. This model is tested in the context of an electronic medical record (EMR) system implementation, with a sample of 442 clinicians who were exposed to various influence tactics and with the use of SEM techniques. The results indicate that certain influence tactics are beneficial in reducing user resistance while others can unintentionally increase resistance. Resistance, in turn, drives adaptive user behaviors in the form of unfaithful use of the system. Thus, it is possible to manipulate resistance and resultant adaptive behaviors through influence tactics, without necessarily altering the IT artifact. This is particularly important, as many off-the-shelf IT artifacts cannot be substantially modified. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."

Predicting frequent, preventable readmissions and understanding the contributing factors is a critical problem that is being widely studied. However, few studies have examined longitudinal risk stratification, profiling, and prediction of multi-morbid, heterogeneous patient populations. We examine how readmission risk may progress over multiple emergency department visits of chronic disease patients, their early stratification into distinct trajectories with related frequencies, and the relationship of these trajectories to patient characteristics. We further extend this analysis to investigate the impact of time-stable and time-varying covariates in predicting future readmission conditional on latent class membership. Results indicate that longitudinal risk stratification can enable early identification of specific patient groups following distinct trajectories based on their presentation for emergency care. Prediction models that incorporate latent classes perform well and demonstrate the promise of trajectory modeling methods combined with advanced prediction models for longitudinal risk assessment in addressing readmission challenges.

Drawing upon feedback intervention theory, the paper develops a model that examines how a telemonitoring feedback ecosystem (patient, telemonitoring technology, care provider) is related to patient behavioral outcomes. More precisely, we study the cascading effects of two types of technology feedback (medical and compliance alerts) on the provision of three types of feedback (outcome, corrective, and personal) given by care providers, and how the feedback in turn is related to patient adaptation and ultimately to calls to 911. Using generalized linear mixed modeling, we tested our hypotheses with longitudinal data from 212 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and/or chronic heart failure (CHF) over 26 weeks. Our results show that medical alerts had a positive association with all three types of provider feedback. By contrast, compliance alerts had curvilinear relationships with corrective and personal feedback. Our results also show that outcome feedback and personal feedback were associated with increases in patient adaptations. Patient adaptation was negatively related to the odds of calling 911. Interestingly, we found a significant negative interaction between outcome and corrective feedback and patient adaptation. Finally, our results show that while the frequency of feedback decreased over the life of the program, the amount of adaptations increased over the same period, which suggests that patient self-management improved over time. By examining a telemonitoring-based ecosystem with two stages of feedback, our study contributes to the chronic disease management literature as well as to other contexts where monitoring technologies deliver feedback that is mediated by a third party.

Patients diagnosed with asthma may experience significantly reduced quality of life if their asthma is not properly controlled. To facilitate better asthma self-management, asthma specialists and engineers have developed the smart asthma management system (SAM). This new health information system provides Bluetooth-enabled inhalers and collects time stamps of every rescue inhaler use. Such detailed inhaler usage logs, which are crucial for investigating patterns of inhaler usage, were not available in traditional clinical trials because clinical trials acquire data only periodically. Due to the low data collection resolution of clinical trials, quantitative asthma studies based on trial data have been focusing mainly on capturing the increasing trend in the number of rescue inhaler uses. Taking advantage of the patient monitoring capability of the SAM system, we developed a data analytics framework for detecting abnormal inhaler use that is out of the patient's normal usage pattern. The new statistical model developed in this paper can address the key features of the data collected from the SAM system such as the heterogeneous impact of environmental factors on inhaler usage behavior and the correlation structure governed by the patient's repetitive routines.

While healthcare organizations have traditionally focused on treating the complications of chronic diseases, advances in information technology (IT) and analytics can help clinicians and patients manage and slow the progression of chronic diseases to result in higher quality of life for patients and lower healthcare costs. We build on prior research to introduce the notion of temporal displacement of care (TDC), in which IT and analytics create healthcare value by displacing the time at which providers and patients make interventions to improve healthcare outcomes and reduce costs. We propose that healthcare value is created by strategic actions taken at specific points-in-time during the treatment process. Our theoretical development identifies TDC mechanisms through which IT and analytics displace later high cost interventions in favor of earlier preventative procedures. We test our hypotheses using four years of data on 45,000 cardio-metabolic patients from the U.S. state of Vermont, which implemented a Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) program. Our study includes four cohorts with increasing levels of IT and analytics use: (1) non-PCMH practices, (2) PCMH practices with basic IT systems installed, (3) practices that completed data quality sprints (DQS) to increase use of IT systems, and (4) practices that use analytics through the Vermont Healthcare Information Exchange (VHIE). Our results provide insights into how TDC effects develop over time. In Year 1 after implementation, the DQS cohort demonstrates a marked increase in the use of preventative procedures such as eye exams and neuropathy screenings, the increase becomes more pronounced in Years 2 and 3, and the increase is even greater for the VHIE cohort. As the use of preventative procedures increases, emergency department utilization decreases, with a more pronounced decrease for the VHIE cohort than the DQS cohort. By Year 2, the DQS and VHIE cohorts experience a decrease in total healthcare costs, with a greater decrease for the VHIE cohort than the DQS cohort. By Year 3, the healthcare outcomes indicator of Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level is statistically significantly lower, with a greater decrease for the VHIE cohort than the DQS cohort. The increased use of low-intervention healthcare treatments earlier in the process leads to a decrease in overall healthcare costs, which then leads to an improvement in healthcare indicators. © 2020 University of Minnesota.

Drawing on the “patient-physician partnership” paradigm in managing chronic disease (Bodenheimer et al. 2002), we argue that physician-driven OHC facilitates patient-physician collaborative care and self-management support, which may improve patient wellbeing and patient-physician relationships. We test the mutual impact between patients' and physicians' participation in physician-driven OHC and the impact of patients' and physicians' participation on patient well-being and the patient-physician relationship in the context of managing diabetes and depression. We collect data from a leading Chinese online consultation platform. To make credible causal inference, we exploit two events that separately create plausibly exogenous variations in patients' and physicians' participation. We find that physicians' participation significantly increases patients' participation for both diabetes and depression, but patients' participation only increases physicians' participation for depression. Although both patients' and physicians' participation significantly improve patient well-being and the patient-physician relationship, there are interesting nuances in these effects over time.

In this study, we assess the impact of EHR adoption and use on the practices of U.S. healthcare stakeholders and the institutional logics that they instantiate. We identify four prominent logics around the adoption and use of EHR systems'medical professionalism, private sector managerialism, technical design, and regulatory oversight. Our analysis reveals the ways in which practices enacted through EHR systems interact to engender a confluence of the institutional logics that mark the field. Specifically, we theorize a mechanism by which the reticulation, or intertwining, of practices mediated by an EHR system variously fosters complementarity and conflict between institutional logics based on the commensurability of the organizing principles invoked. This proposed framework offers a novel approach to the role of information system use in the institutional dynamics of the healthcare system. In addition, this research offers a range of practical insights regarding the ways in which the diverse institutional logics of the U.S. healthcare system may be impacted by the growth of EHR system use.

The success of OHCs in promoting health, however, depends not just on posting activity by participants, but, crucially, on whether or not responses are subsequently received. While previous studies have considered various mechanisms by which the likelihood of social support provisioning can be increased (e.g., the establishment of social capital), the impacts of linguistic signals have yet to be considered. Therefore, we consider whether or not linguistic signals in posts—including sentiment valence, linguistic style matching, readability, post length, and spelling—impact the amount of support received. Adopting an overarching theoretical framework of signaling theory, this study proposes a model that explains the signaling roles of linguistic features within OHC posts in promoting social support provision from OHC participants. The research model is empirically tested on a large dataset collected from an OHC platform covering multiple health conditions. Results show that affective linguistic signals, including negative sentiment and linguistic style matching, are effective in invoking both informational and emotional support from the community. We also find that informative linguistic signals including readability, post length, and spelling are positively associated with informational support receipt, while readability and spelling are also positively associated with emotional support receipt. Overall, this research not only enriches our current understandings of the linguistic signaling in OHCs, but also provides practical insights into improving social support exchange in OHCs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."

However, determining efficient and effective daily home-dialysis service plans imposes multiple challenges to hospital administrators, as it is a complex task with a number of interrelated decisions. These decisions are about the number of nurses required for daily visits and their travel itineraries, and involve multiple (often conflicting) objectives. Working together with physicians and administrators from The Ottawa Hospital (TOH) in Canada, we have developed a system intended to support administrators of nephrology departments in creating daily visit schedules and routes for nurses assisting with dialysis treatment in patients' homes. The decision support system, called Home Dialysis Scheduler System (HDSS), employs a mixed-integer linear programming model to create daily nurse itineraries that minimize the cost of providing home dialysis for a pre-specified group of patients. In developing this model, we also considered nurses' workload balance, overtime work, need for mealtime breaks (lunch or dinner, depending on shift times), restrictions and preferences associated with the time of the visits, and different types of services provided to patients. The model was validated using data provided by the Division of Nephrology at TOH. The interface of the HDSS was developed following the principles of user-centred design and validated with a group of end-users. In the validation stage, daily visit schedules and nurse routes generated by the HDSS were compared to nurse itineraries created manually by hospital administrators. The use of the HDSS resulted in improved workload distribution among nurses, simpler routes, and reduced total distance travelled — which translates into lower costs for the home dialysis program. In this paper, we provide details about the mixed-integer linear programming model, describe the HDSS, and discuss its implementation results and managerial implications. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."

We posit that IT plays a vital role in enhancing revenue by increasing net patient revenue and decreasing the uncompensated care ratio. Using unique datasets from various proprietary resources, we test the relationships between IT (clinical and business) investment and revenue management performance using dynamic panel data models with the generalized method of moments (GMM). Empirical results generally support our hypotheses. We found that both clinical and business IT investment have short-term and long-term effects on boosting net patient revenue and that clinical IT investment has a short-term contemporaneous effect on reducing the uncompensated care ratio. Moderation analyses suggest that: (1) larger hospitals tend to utilize business IT systems better in facilitating revenue management through both channels over the long run, but not necessarily using clinical IT; and (2) for-profit hospitals outperform their nonprofit counterparts when it comes to managing revenues through clinical IT; however, no interaction effect with business IT was found.

Technostress is often characterized by IS researchers as negative, or as being on the ""dark side"" of technology. However, a broader reading of the stress literature suggests that technostress may be both positive and negative, and can therefore have a ""bright side"" in addition to a dark side. The objective of this study is to conceptualize a holistic technostress process that includes positive and negative components of technostress embedded in two subprocesses: The techno-eustress subprocess and the techno-distress subprocess, respectively. The study instantiates this holistic technostress model through a sequential mixed-methods research design in the context of HIT. Phase 1 of the design is a qualitative, interpretive case study involving interviews with 32 nurses. Based on the findings from the case study, the paper builds a research model that operationalizes the concepts embedded in the holistic technostress model and identifies contextually relevant challenge and hindrance technostressors and outcomes. In Phase 2, the research model is empirically validated by analyzing survey data collected from 402 nurses employed in the United States. Results reveal that several challenge and hindrance technostressors are related to positive and negative psychological responses, respectively, and that such responses are related to job satisfaction and attrition, which impact turnover intention.

Using a large data set covering all emergency visits in New York State from 2010 to 2014, we investigate whether telemedicine enhances ER care delivery. We show that, on average, telemedicine availability in the ER significantly reduces average patients' length of stay (LOS), which is partially driven by the flexible resource allocation. Specifically, the adoption of telemedicine leads to a larger reduction in ER LOS when there is a demand surge or supply shortage. Furthermore, such improvement is not a by-product of other widely adopted health IT applications and does not come at the expense of care quality or patient cost. We also replicate the analysis using annual U.S. hospital data and find that ER telemedicine adoption significantly reduces average patients' waiting time, which suggests that the LOS reduction partially comes from the reduction of waiting time. © 2020 INFORMS."

Our study seeks to understand the effectiveness of physician-patient communication at telecamps with several salient characteristics: rural underprivileged patients, physicians in remote cities, and frugal telemedicine technology—specifically, videoconferencing—deployed in Hospitals on Wheels and appropriated by operators. We adopt a multiple-actor perspective, propose a decomposed affordance-effectivity framework, and combine variance and process perspectives to examine the phenomenon of interest. We collaborated with Apollo Hospitals, a leading hospital system in India, and collected multisource data from two major telecamps in rural South India. Based on an analysis of survey data from 216 telecamp participants through a variance perspective, we found support for the fit of patient-perceived media richness with two contingency factors—(1) disease diagnostic complexity and (2) patient healthcare needs fulfillment—in influencing patient satisfaction with teleconsultation. Based on an analysis of 46 sessions of teleconsultation video archives through a process perspective, we found that technology appropriation is realized through verbal and nonverbal communication events between patients and physicians, with on-site operators playing multiple roles that serve as “compensatory user effectivity.” Our findings yield theoretical and practical implications for how effective telemedicine encounters using frugal technologies can be designed in combination with other cost-effective support personnel resources to broaden healthcare access for underprivileged individuals in less developed countries and, more broadly, to actualize technology affordances in use situations involving multiple actors. © 2020, Association for Information Systems.

One solution, Bluetooth-enabled digital proximity tracing using smartphones, promises to preserve individual privacy while helping to contain society-wide viral outbreaks. However, this digital solution works effectively only if adopted by the majority of the population. This poses a collective action problem: everyone would benefit from wide-spread proximity tracing, but the benefits for the individual are indirect and limited. To facilitate such collective action at the societal level, this paper conceptualises the option space of IT governance actions for proximity tracing adoption along two dimensions: decision-making entities (who will govern the roll-out) and accountability enforcement (how strictly will adoption and use be enforced). Examining coherent governance approaches that arise from the framework, we show that there are no globally ideal approaches but only locally contextualised ones that depend on immediate health risk, prior experience with pandemics, societal values and national culture, role of government, trust in government and trust in technology in each society.

Drawing on Social Cognitive Theory, Social Exchange Theory, Goal-setting Theory, and people's dependency on smartphones, we develop a composite intervention using both positive and negative reinforcements, goal-setting, and social connections. The m-health intervention provides decision support to patients in their medication-taking process. With multiple intervention scenarios, healthcare professionals have baselines to adjust the intervention to meet patients' needs. We validate our design using analytical modeling and show that (1) high medication adherence is achievable by the composite intervention for single and multiple medications, (2) negative reinforcement (NR) leads to better MA outcomes in addition to positive reinforcement (PR), (3) the intervention can maintain effectiveness in the operational environment due to its adaptability, and, (4) the estimated healthcare savings are significant even for slightly improved medication adherence. Our research is the first to utilize NR in intervention design to enhance MA and to categorize patients based on elements derived from theories while providing technical and behavioral interventions for both unintentional as well as intentional non-adherence.

However, the path to large-scale electronic health record implementation is seldom smooth, involving multiple stakeholders with diverse interests and influences. This study proposes a framework that draws on both stakeholder and institutional theories to understand the complex dynamics of stakeholder interactions and institutional pressures over time during electronic health record systems implementation. This framework is utilized to analyze the national electronic health record programs of Singapore and England, which provide contrasting perspectives on how two top-down system implementations took place with different outcomes. Our results suggest that in the Singapore case, the presence of boundary spanners, supporting implementation agency that included IT staff from healthcare organizations, and greater engagement with medical professionals were associated with more positive dynamics of stakeholder interactions (e.g. limited pushback from professionals or the press) during electronic health record implementation than in England. Differences in the healthcare structures and systems, electronic health record project organization, and the combined influences of institutional pressures shed light on the varying implementation paths and outcomes in the two cases. This study adds to the health information technology literature through a comparative examination of the organizational and social processes during complex national healthcare integration projects.

However, the impact of PQRS on physicians is unclear, particularly as related to their online reputation. Is there an association between a physician’s online reputation and her adherence to clinical guidelines stipulated in the PQRS? Is online reputation associated with use of electronic health records (EHR)? To investigate these questions, we combine data on online physician reviews with the PQRS data on clinical guideline adherence and EHR use. Unlike prior research, which primarily uses clinical outcomes as proxies for care quality, our study uses adherence to clinical guidelines, a process measure that reflects physician conformance with evidence-based clinical practices. In addition, we focus on EHR use at the physician level, in contrast to the usual approach of examining it at the aggregate institutional level. Consistent with the economic theory of credence goods, we observe no significant relationship between physicians’ adherence to clinical guidelines and their online reviews. Although there is some evidence of association between EHR use and their overall rating, similar relationships are not consistently observed for individual dimensional ratings. Overall, the online reputation of a physician exhibits minimal association with her actual clinical activities — and is mostly driven by latent topics in the textual reviews — implying that the ability of online reviews to inform prospective patients of care quality might be quite limited. Therefore, patients should be cautious when using online physician reviews, and policymakers should increase the accessibility of PQRS and other similar data to help patients make informed physician choices. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

Therefore, the question of whether online reviews reflect the currently available information is of high importance.

We address this research gap and analyze whether restaurant health inspection results have an impact on the review generation process of online restaurant reviews. We find that while severe health inspection results lead to changes of online review star ratings, information processing depends on the current environment. We find indications for corrective actions after critical health inspections: on the one hand, the restaurant health score improves, which shows an increase in restaurant quality. On the other hand, we observe indications for an increased amount of fake reviews in case of poorly-graded restaurants. We contribute to theory by providing an understanding of the nature of information processing on online review platforms. For practitioners, our findings allow for an understanding of the dynamics of online review generation.

This study proposes and tests a model that examines how online interactional unfairness (ie, interpersonal unfairness and informational unfairness) influences online patient–doctor relationship quality and the contingent roles of a doctor’s professional seniority and a patient’s disease severity. Using archival data with 83,553 observations from a leading online health-consultation platform in China, this study employed rare-event logistic regression to test the model. The results show that online interpersonal unfairness and online informational unfairness have negative and positive effects on relationship-quality incentive, respectively, in the Chinese health care context and that a doctor’s professional seniority and a patient’s disease severity strengthen the link between unfairness perceptions and relationship-quality incentive.

The main objective of the present study is to explore the benefits of adopting the social network analysis (SNA) approach to investigate the determinants of a patient's choice of healthcare provider as a way to support better resource allocation decisions in healthcare systems. For the purpose of the analysis, administrative data was used to track the flow of patients within orthopaedic departments of the Lombardy region (Italy) in 2014. A network was developed with two types of nodes: those of orthopaedic departments in the regional hospitals (114 nodes), and those of municipalities (5092 nodes). Using the Louvain algorithm, the communities and sub-communities were determined on the basis of patients’ choices, without any prior geographical considerations or planned catchment areas. Traditional SNA measures and other novel indicators, specifically developed for this study, were applied: in particular, attractiveness (i.e. the preference that patients assign to a certain department against the others available in the same reference area) and confinement (of demand) (i.e. the degree of the unique use of a certain department). A decision support matrix based on these indicators was defined for decision makers to use in evaluating department profiles, and optimizing the location of services and allocation of resources, while preserving accessibility to care and patients’ preferences. The decision support matrix was also evaluated on the basis of real practice and decisions made by regional healthcare managers. © 2019"

Drawing on Bourdieu's forms of capital and the logic of digital options, we develop an integrative conceptual framework to identify and organize antecedents of digital advantage, which can translate to hospital performance through the creation of digital options. Focusing on the antecedents of digital advantage for our research model and hypotheses, we suggest that digital advantage is influenced by (1) economic capital, (2) institutional-arrangement-based social capital that results in knowledge sharing through information exchange networks and parent organization membership, (3) geographic-proximity-based social capital due to locational externalities that facilitate knowledge spillover, and (4) cultural capital that reflects the hospital's health information technology (HIT) knowledge stock. Our findings, based on the aggregate adoption of 90 HITs by 953 hospitals, support main effects; complementary effects of the two forms of social capital; and substitutive effects between (1) economic capital and other forms of capital such that cultural capital and both types of social capital mitigate the effects of inadequate economic capital, and between (2) institutionalarrangement- based social capital and cultural capital such that knowledge shared through institutional arrangements mitigates the effects of having inadequate in-house HIT expertise.

To facilitate and inform provider selection decisions, healthcare organizations offer physician review services and publish the provided reviews on their websites. However, if such reviews are highly skewed, significantly inaccurate, and systematically biased, they could mislead patients. This is against healthcare organizations’ responsibility of acting in the best interests of patients. To shed light on this phenomenon, this study examines two types of bias, namely between-website and within-website biases, in the online reviews of physicians posted on healthcare organizations’ websites. Reviews belonging to 1921 physicians were collected from two data sources: (1) websites of the hospitals that the physicians were affiliated with and (2) four commercial physician rating websites including HealthGrades, RateMDs, Vitals, and Google Reviews. To test between-website biases, the ratings posted on the healthcare organizations’ websites were compared against the corresponding ratings on the commercial websites. Our results suggest that the ratings provided by healthcare institutions are generally, more skewed toward scores favorable to physicians, and less dispersed, than corresponding ratings reported on commercial websites. The within-website results also supported the argument that physicians with different rating scores systematically receive different number of ratings and comments. Our findings highlight the fact that hospitals that publish physician ratings should try to identify and reduce rating biases to help patients make more informed and judicious clinical decisions, realizing the responsibility of healthcare providers in protecting patients’ rights and safety. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."

Although health inspection programs are designed to protect consumers, such inspections typically occur at wide intervals of time, allowing restaurant hygiene to remain unmonitored in the interim periods. Information provided in online reviews may be effectively used in these interim periods to gauge restaurant hygiene. In this paper, we use textual information from online reviews of restaurants to effectively identify cases of hygiene violations in restaurants, even after the restaurants have been inspected and certified, thereby identifying moral hazard. Using a data set of restaurant hygiene inspections in New York City from 2010 through 2016 and the associated set of online reviews for the same set of restaurants from Yelp, we use supervised machine learning techniques to develop a hygiene dictionary specifically crafted to identify hygiene-related concerns. The use of this dictionary and the related word counts in online reviews allows us to identify systematic instances of moral hazard, wherein restaurants with positive hygiene inspection scores are seen to regress in their hygiene maintenance within 90 days of receiving the inspection scores. To the extent that social media provide some visibility into the hygiene practices of restaurants, we argue that the effects of information asymmetry that lead to moral hazard may be partially mitigated in this context. Based on our work, we also provide strategies for how cities and policymakers may design effective restaurant inspection programs, through a combination of traditional inspections and the appropriate use of social media.

In organizations, risk management groups are increasingly interested in working with their information technology teams to develop robust VoC listening platforms. Two key challenges have impeded success. First, prior work has leveraged diverse sets of channels, adverse event types, and modeling methods, resulting in diverging conclusions regarding the viability and efficacy of various user-generated channels and accompanying modeling methods. Second, many existing detection methods rely on “mention models” that have low detection rates, have high false positives, and lack timeliness. Following the information systems design science approach, in this research note we propose a framework for examining key design elements for VoC listening platforms. As part of our framework, we also develop a novel heuristic-based method for detecting adverse events. We evaluate our framework and method on two large test beds each encompassing millions of tweets, forums postings, and search query logs pertaining to hundreds of adverse events related to the pharmaceutical and automotive industries. The results shed light on the interplay between user-generated channels and event types, as well as the potential for more robust event modeling methods that go beyond basic mention models. Our analysis framework reveals that user-generated content channels can facilitate timelier detection of adverse events: on average, two to three years or earlier than commonly used databases. The inclusion of negative sentiment polarity in the models can further reduce false-positive rates. Additionally, we find social media channels provide higher detection rates but lower precision than do search-based signals. The search and web forum channels are timelier than Twitter. The proposed heuristic-based method attains markedly better results than do existing methods—with earlier detection rates of 50%–80% and far fewer false positives across an array of VoC channels and event types.

However, very few studies examine how the effect of social norms is differentially manifest across individuals, especially in the contemporary socially connected digital world. We conjecture that the effects of social norms are conditional on an individual’s digital social ties and provide new empirical evidence from a randomized field experiment that included more than 7,000 individuals on an online physical activity community observed for a two-month period. In our investigation of the effect of social norms on users’ goal-setting and goal attainment behaviors, we find a significant moderating role for social connectivity: individuals with higher levels of social connectivity are more susceptible to a social norms message containing information indicating the number of users in this community who set a goal in the pretreatment month. Additional analysis reveals that individuals who have many followers (i.e., high in-degree) but do not follow many others (low out-degree) are the most susceptible to the social norms treatment. Strikingly, we find that social norms also lead to a substantially lower rate of goal attainment compared with the control message that simply highlights the benefits of setting a goal. This adverse effect is also heterogeneously experienced, conditional on the number of social ties. Our findings have important implications for the design of interventions based on social norms.

In this study, we examine how the adoption of EHRs and an MU initiative affect the occurrence of breaches of patient information. We also study whether and how EHRs and MU initiatives may increase the risk of accidental and malicious breaches of patient information. Using data from multiple sources, such as the American Hospital Association (AHA), the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) AnalyticsÔ Database, and the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse (PRC), our study shows that implementing EHRs leads to a 3.081 times higher risk of a breach of patient information. This heightened risk is mostly driven by the occurrence of more accidental breaches. Although the effect of an MU initiative on the overall number of breaches is not significant, undertaking MU increases the risk of accidental breaches 1.771 times. We also found that these risks increased more among relatively larger hospitals. However, simply having more components of EHRs does not necessarily increase the risk of breaches. Overall, our findings show that breaches of patient information may be rooted in the digitized data and processes enabled by technologies such as EHRs and their usage rather than resident in the technological components themselves. We conclude that, despite recent evidence that usage of EHRS has improved the quality of healthcare, quality must go hand in hand with the protection of patient information.

Using a longitudinal case study of HMIS in Kenya, we investigate the crucial role of identity work as a mechanism that links information technology (IT) affordances to institutions. In particular, our study revealed four types of identity work (disruptive, legitimizing, reinforcing, and transformative) that, through different affordances, led to distinct institutional consequences in terms of either maintaining or deinstitutionalizing existing dysfunctional HMIS-related routines and practices.

Such crowdsourcing platforms empower patients to harness the “wisdom of the crowd” by providing access to a vast pool of diverse medical knowledge. Greater participation in crowdsourcing increases the likelihood of encountering a correct solution. However, more participation also leads to increased “noise,” which makes identifying the most likely solution from a broader pool of recommendations (i.e., diagnostic suggestions) difficult. The challenge for medical crowdsourcing platforms is to increase participation of both patients and solution providers, while simultaneously increasing the efficacy and accuracy of solutions. The primary objectives of this study are: (1) to investigate means to enhance the solution pool by increasing participation of solution providers referred to as “medical detectives” or “detectives,” and (2) to explore ways of selecting the most likely diagnosis from a set of alternative possibilities recommended by medical detectives. Our results suggest that our strategy of using multiple methods for evaluating recommendations by detectives leads to better predictions. Furthermore, cases with higher perceived quality and more negative emotional tones (e.g., sadness, fear, and anger) attract more detectives.

Specifically, we investigate how the implementation of enterprise systems-in the form of electronic health records-affects the decision of physicians to continue practicing at their current hospital. Results suggest that when enterprise systems create complementarities for professionals, their duration of practice at the organization increases significantly. However, when technologies are disruptive and force professionals to alter their routines, there is a pronounced exodus from the organization.

These technologies pair devices that have various embedded sensors with one or more apps to allow for the collection, analysis, socialization, and management of individuals' health and wellness data. We have limited insight into what drives the use of fitness technologies or how they may contribute to wellness outcomes. To address this gap, our study examines how exercise goals are related to fitness technology feature set use and how the use is associated with a measure of the exercisers' psychological well-being (ie, subjective vitality). We find that intrinsic exercise goals (eg, enjoyment or competence) are associated with the use of features that allow users to collect, analyse, and inform their exercise progress. Body-focused extrinsic exercise goals (eg, appearance) are also associated with the use of such features but are negatively associated with features that socialize exercise. The social extrinsic exercise goal is associated with the use of more controlling features that can provide external pressure from the technology or other people. The social features of fitness technologies are associated with higher levels of subjective vitality. Our findings indicate that exercisers who have goals where measuring progress may be desired (eg, losing weight and training for a marathon) are more likely to be drawn to the data management aspects of fitness technologies, whereas using fitness technologies to socialize exercise may add an element of enjoyment that is attractive to some users and may lead to increased well-being. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

Indeed, the utilization of m-health by older adults can foster the development of proactive patients, while also reducing financial burden and resource pressures on health systems. However, the potentially transformative influence of m-health is limited, as many older adults resist adoption leading to the emergence of an age-based digital divide. This study leverages protection motivation theory and social cognitive theory to explore the factors driving resistance among older adults. This mixed methods study integrates survey findings with insights from qualitative interviews to highlight that the m-health digital divide is deepening due to older adults' perceived inability to adopt and their unwillingness to adopt stemming from mistrust, high risk perceptions, and strong desire for privacy. The paper contributes to the privacy and social inclusion literature by demonstrating that while many older adults have access to m-health, they are currently excluded and require careful consideration by technology organizations and researchers. The study provides recommendations for narrowing the m-health digital divide through inclusive design and educational efforts to improve self-efficacy, develop privacy literacy, and build trust, thereby ensuring that older citizens are both capable and willing to adopt. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

A unique panel dataset was analyzed using a lagged model approach to determine the effects of signals of quality, awareness, and content variance on hospital prominence and quality as well as the impact of reputation on financial performance. The findings suggest that quality signals significantly impact patient-perceived quality ratings, and signals of awareness and content variance significantly impact prominence rating.

Finally, we discuss the implications of these analyses and suggest potential areas for future research. Overall, we contribute a foundation for IS health care researchers to consider how to position their work to contribute to knowledge through informational and organizational theory as well as to address important concerns of practice at the intersection of health and IS. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"

However, little research has been done to identify the determinants of health information exchange. By integrating aspects of the social cognitive theory and perceived interactivity, this study proposes a research model to investigate the antecedents of health information exchange in social media. Data collected from Facebook users with health information exchange experience were used to examine the proposed model. The results demonstrate that human-to-human interaction, human-to-information interaction, outcome expectation of health self-management competence, and outcome expectation of social relationships have a significant impact on health information exchange behavior. The results also reveal that human-to-human interaction exerts a significant influence on the outcome expectation of health self-management competence and the outcome expectation of social relationships, while human-to-information interaction has a positive effect on the outcome expectation of health self-management competence. The implications for the theory and practice and future research directions are discussed. © 2018 Elsevier B.V."

Such legislation applies to the procurement of software packages by public institutions in many countries. This study explores how tendering legislation shapes a buyer's software selection process through the lens of competing decision-making rationalities. From the literature, 3 rationalities enacted in software selection are deduced that we relate to the software selection literature regarding tendering legislation. Through this lens, we subsequently examine how a large health care provider selected a supplier for an electronic health record system after an extensive tendering process. Many health care professionals within this organization were in favour of a particular software package. Yet, the organization purchased a different package from a relatively unknown supplier, the implementation of which failed. The actors involved experienced shaping on 5 decision-making themes, the implications of which are evaluated against the functional, economic, and political rationality norms derived from the literature. The findings suggest that compliance with tendering legislation over the public procurement of software results in increased legal complexity, greater linearity and objectivity, more extensive formalization, and less relational communication. Functional norms of rationality are stressed, seemingly to balance the enforced economic norms of rationality and to compensate for the decreased room for political rationality. Even so, the shaping by the tendering legislation threatens functional rationality. Ultimately functional and economic norms of rationality win over political rationality, yet the latter still dribbles through, albeit in a different guise than reported for software selection in general.

In recent years, many researchers have used predictive analytics to build models that can minimize the adverse economic and social consequences of readmissions in chronic diseases. Most of these studies, however, have focused on improving the results either through the development of better models or through employing richer data sets. A very small number of them have focused on a comprehensive data preprocessing to improve the efficacy of analytics methods for better predictions. In this study, we propose a new data processing approach that extracts individual- and database-level historical information from the medical records to improve the performance of readmission analytics. We test and validate this method using two rather large data sets that belong to chronic diseases with the highest rates of hospital readmissions. We conclude that proper processing of large clinical data sets with analytics and big data technologies can provide competitive advantages to health care organizations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V."

Stakeholder groups are typically socialized differently and may have different perspectives on IT governance dilemmas. Yet, extant literature offers only limited insight on socialized views on IT governance. This study uses an institutional logics lens to examine how competing institutional logics get connected in IT governance practices through dominant stakeholders’ enactment patterns and how these enactment patterns may affect the organization’s IT performance. We find that logics were coupled to the three dominant stakeholder groups, but only loosely so. Congruence between the three logics they enacted depended on the IT governance dilemma at hand. Our findings demonstrate how within a triad of competing logics, switching rivalry among hybrid logics may develop. Here, the enactments led to two hybrid logics, none of which became dominant. Remarkably, the IT professionalism logic accommodated polarization between medical professionalism and the managerial logic, causing unstable IT governance. We propose that IT professionalism offers room for agency and is crucial in determining the resulting enactment patterns: polarizing, compromising or even synthesizing. This study may raise managers’ awareness of the competing logics underlying IT governance practices and clarify the pivotal role of IT professionalism in IT governance debates. © 2017, © 2017 The Author(s).

These responses encompass a variety of emotions, such as excitement, indifference, skepticism, and fear, and behaviors, such as user engagement, avoidance, and workarounds, that are often manifested concurrently in the same work environment. We present a taxonomy of these responses in the context of mandated IT use by classifying user responses as engaged, compliant, reluctant, or deviant. Using a coping theoretic lens, we offer seven propositions to describe the causal factors and processes that drive specific IT user responses and how such responses might change over time. A qualitative analysis of 47 interviews of 42 physicians at a large community hospital over an 8-year period provides support for our taxonomy and propositions. The study’s key contributions are that it conceptualizes different types of user responses that may emerge in mandatory IT use settings, elaborates the key drivers of and processes underlying these diverse responses, and suggests how those behaviors may change over time with changes in the coping process. © 2017, © 2017 The Author(s).

While most of the literature is still focusing on the exposition of the unbound potential of PSN, this paper seeks to clarify the question of how to capture and manage the professional identity of an industry such that PSN can be purposefully anchored in the working context. Following an Action Design Research approach, we describe practical design propositions and possible tensions along the contextualization of a PSN, which was specifically catered for improving interprofessional and interorganizational collaboration in and between hospitals. We identify several implications for future research. In particular, we explain intended and unintended uses of PSN in hospitals and provide metaphors for explaining possible alternative understandings of domain engineering. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

Research is needed to determine if there are factors that influence readmission penalties but may be out of the control of hospitals. In this study, we compare a set of geo-demographic, hospital, and quality of care characteristics of hospitals penalized by HRRP with those not penalized, and determine these characteristics’ association with the likelihood of penalization as well as the extent of penalties. We collected and integrated data from multiple sources such as the HRRP Supplemental Data File, the Hospital Compare database, CMS Impact files, the HCAHPS survey, and the U.S. census. We followed a two-step estimation procedure. First, we estimated a logistic regression model to find the relationship between various characteristics and whether a hospital was penalized. Second, we estimated a linear regression model to find the relationship between these characteristics and the extent of penalties. Results show that both the likelihood and the extent of penalties varied across several characteristics related to geo-demographics (such as location in the census division, urban vs. rural location, and racial make-up of the area), hospitals (such as ownership, bed capacity, teaching status, and case mix index), and quality of care (such as quality of communication by doctors and information provided at the time of discharge). Although quality of care characteristics are under hospitals’ control and can be improved, geo-demographic and hospital characteristics are likely consistent over time and largely out of the control of hospitals.

By providing an interorganizational information system (IOIS) and governance over use of this system and the information exchanged through it, HIEs enable more routine and efficient electronic sharing of patient information between disparate and fragmented healthcare providers. This should result in improved quality and efficiency of care. However, significant questions persist about the extent to which HIEs produce these benefits in practice, particularly in terms of reducing healthcare spending. We use transaction cost economics (TCE) to theorize that HIEs establish a quasi-hierarchy that decreases frictions associated with information sharing in ways that reduce healthcare spending, and that the magnitude of reductions is greater when (1) insurer and provider incentives align, and (2) HIE capabilities mature. We can test these conjectures because HIEs, unlike other efforts that provide IOIS, are typically confined to regional markets and develop heterogeneously between these markets, introducing variation in insurer-provider incentive alignment and HIE maturity. Leveraging a unique national panel data set, we evaluate whether HIEs reduce spending for the largest insurer in the United States, i.e., Medicare, and whether incentives and HIE maturity modify the magnitude of reductions. We find significant spending reductions in healthcare markets that have established operational HIEs, with an average reduction of $139 per Medicare beneficiary per year (1.4% decrease) or a $3.12 billion annual reduction in spending if HIEs were nationally implemented in 2015.We also find that these reductions occur disproportionately in healthcare markets where providers have financial incentives to use an HIE to reduce spending and when HIEs are more mature. Our results inform an important open empirical question in the healthcare domain related to the value of HIEs, while also joining perspectives from TCE with the IOIS literature to understand the factors that may be relevant to IOIS value creation more generally. © 2018 INFORMS."

Within most studies that have been performed on this topic, it appears that any ensemble-based model often achieves better results than those estimated with a single model designed using the base classifier of the ensemble, but it is not uncommon that the results of the former model do not outperform those of a single model when estimated with any other classifier. Indeed, an ensemble of decision trees is almost always more accurate than a single tree but not necessarily more than a neural network or a support vector machine. We know that the accuracy of an ensemble used to forecast firm bankruptcy is closely related to its ability to capture the variety of bankruptcy situations. But the fact that it may not be more efficient than a single model suggests that current techniques used to handle such a variety are not completely satisfactory. This is why we have looked for a method that makes it possible to better embody this diversity than current ones do.

To ensure that the public health reporting system is appropriately monitoring the rare infectious diseases under surveillance, it is recommended to have a regular assessment of timeliness, especially after the rare infectious case is confirmed. This study aimed to evaluate the timeliness of data reported to the Ohio Disease Reporting System (ODRS), a public health reporting system in Ohio, for managing rare infectious diseases. In a cross-sectional analysis of rare infectious disease reporting data in four local health jurisdictions (LHJs) in the state of Ohio, wide delays were found between various reporting steps, particularly when the laboratories were not using the electronic method of reporting, and the delay observed was mainly at the hospital level and at the LHJ level. This study highlights the supply chain nature of information transfer and calculates the delay at various interacting points of the information supply chain system. The results establish that a centralized approach with an electronic disease reporting system conveys information faster than traditional reporting channels (decentralized approach). Delays of the decentralized approach are isolated at various stakeholder levels and with respect to various types of rare infectious diseases for better understanding of the information supply chain system for managing rare infectious diseases. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."

We focus on the role of ICTs in self-management (SM) of diabetes, a chronic disease. Chronic diseases, declared an invisible epidemic by the World Health Organization, cause and perpetuate poverty and impede the economic development of many countries. As a means of informing the design of ICTs that facilitate self-management, we draw on value sensitive design (VSD) to conduct an in-depth interpretive field study to reveal the values that are important to diabetic patients. Specifically, we reveal twelve values shared by these patients: accessibility, accountability, autonomy, compliance, dignity, empathy, feedback, hope, joy, privacy, sense-making, and trust. A conceptual model emerged from analyzing interviews with diabetic patients; this model explains how these values, which are integrated into ICT features, afford or constrain patients’ abilities to self-manage their activities. This study makes multiple theoretical contributions: By granting ICT artifacts a clear theoretical status, it advances the field of SM that has nominally covered ICTs; it extends design research by extending the VSD literature and by introducing a valuecentric design perspective to examine a complex sociotechnical system; and it broadens work system theory by applying it in the healthcare space. The study’s findings have implications for design science researchers, healthcare providers, and policymakers. © 2018 by the Association for Information Systems."

The strength of any predictive model depends on the selection of proper predictors. However, despite improvements in acute rejection management and short-term graft survival, the accurate prediction of kidney transplant outcomes remains suboptimal. Among other approaches, machine-learning techniques have the potential to offer solutions to this prediction problem in kidney transplantation. This study offers a novel methodological solution to this prediction problem by: (a) analyzing the retrospective database including > 31,000 U.S. patients; (b) introducing a comprehensive feature selection framework that accounts for medical literature, data analytics methods and elastic net (EN) regression (c) using sensitivity analyses and information fusion to evaluate and combine features from several machine learning approaches (i.e., support vector machines (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN), and Bootstrap Forest (BF)); (d) constructing several different scenarios by merging different sets of features that are optioned through these fused data mining models and statistical models in addition to expert knowledge; and (e) using best performing sets in Bayesian belief network (BBN) algorithm to identify non-linear relationships and the interactions between explanatory factors and risk levels for kidney graft survival. The results showed that the predictor set obtained through fused data mining model and literature review outperformed the all other alternative predictors sets with the scores of 0.602, 0.684, 0.495 for F-Measure, Average Accuracy, and G-Mean, respectively. Overall, our findings provide novel insights about risk prediction that could potentially help in improving the outcome of kidney transplants.

However, because users of these forums tend not to have formal medical training, they often cannot verify objectively the soundness of the advice provided. Thus, there is a need to understand better the mechanism through which people trust and utilise information found on these forums. In testing a theory-based trust model, we find that forum users accept advice more readily as they develop cognitive trust (trust based on a cognitive assessment) and/or affective trust (trust based on an emotional connection). Affective trust is also closely related to formation of relational closeness. This indicates that, while both forms of trust are important, the development of emotional connections provides for long-term OHCs interactions. Findings here, indicate that prior exchanges are not needed to access and utilise OHC community resources. However, trust (developed through prior exchanges) is required for a recipient to leverage the contributor’s social capital for information adoption and relational closeness. These findings allow the distribution of social capital to be viewed in terms of an asymmetrical model where it is possible to accept capital, in the form of advice, without first demonstrating trustworthiness. In the OHC setting the onus is on the contributor of advice to establish trustworthiness, whereas traditionally social capital theory requires receivers of capital to establish trust. These findings are important for site designers and provide insight to managers and developers of OHCs regarding the behaviours and motivations of forum users. © 2017, © Operational Research Society 2017."

Researchers and practitioners alike are now quick to observe that “context matters”, but such an observation does not amount to a coherent alternative vision of more appropriate ICT4D design and implementation. In this paper, we draw on the metaphor of imbrication to elucidate the iterative process by which ICTs become entangled with particular contexts of use. Our longitudinal ethnographic study examines the implementation and iterative redesign of an Internet of things (IoT) technology that collects real-time data and alerts health workers of disruptions in the cold storage of vaccines in Kenya. Extending recent work on imbrication, we show that technologies imbricate not only with the social context but also with local material infrastructure and that designers play a limited yet clearly consequential role in this process. To explain these findings, we highlight instances of material “back talk” and concomitant practice breakdown in which initial attempts to shape a situation yield puzzling or unappreciated consequences, which lead designers to accommodate material realities and, ultimately, pursue unanticipated courses of action. Drawing on these conceptual tools, we reveal six overlapping activities through which designers may guide the emergence of sociomaterial practices. We say that they design for the emergence of sociomaterial practices to underscore that designers cannot predict or control all contextual complexities, though they can adapt to them when they arise. Based on our insights about this process, we develop three contributions. First, we offer fresh perspective on the longstanding concern with local context in ICT4D research. Second, we suggest that our notion of designing for the emergence of sociomaterial practices is relevant for and adds to contextually aware design research frameworks such as action design research. Finally, we propose that ICT4D practitioners should attend to practice breakdowns and material back talk as they grapple with the complexities of the implementation bottleneck in global health and development. © 2017 by the Association for Information Systems."

The idea behind robust and efficient HIS is that health information can allow healthcare managers and providers to better plan and monitor health services, which may translate into better health outcomes. Yet, researchers have often criticized the use of HIS as accountability tools as being counterproductive by making health information more meaningful to national governments and international agencies than those in charge of local health services. In this paper, I analyze how HIS influence the emergence of local accountability practices and their consequences for healthcare provision. I build a theoretical perspective from structuration theory and integrate it with the technology domain of HIS. I use this perspective to analyze a case study of HIS in Kenya. This study raises implications for the use of structuration theory in understanding accountability and the role of IT materiality in processes of structuration. It contributes to a better understanding of how HIS can foster improved healthcare and human development. It also contributes to the understanding of IS as means not just for governing people’s behavior but also of socialization through which users can negotiate multiple accountability goals. © 2017 by the Association for Information Systems."

However, rather than use the system directly, designated users may delegate some parts of their IS use to other users while assuming primary responsibility and accountability for the system use tasks. This behavior is called indirect IS use, a behavior that is acknowledged in some studies but not adequately scrutinized. This research distinguishes between direct and indirect IS use and proposes a model of their respective antecedents. The research was carried out in three stages. First, we conceptually distinguished direct and indirect IS use and drew on a social power lens to develop a theoretically driven research framework. Second, we contextually refined the research framework with a case study in a Confucian society. Third, we validated the research model through a survey of 213 Chinese physicians. Results revealed that direct and indirect IS use are partially substitutive, as demonstrated by the varying effects of social power and physiological power on these types of IS use. Further insights were gained by splitting the two forms of IS use based on the extent of clinical accountability risks and combining the two types of IS use based on their sum or relative amount. With the distinct relationships between social power and different forms of IS use, management could employ the appropriate strategies to influence the desired system usage behavior from its employees. © 2017 INFORMS."

Whereas there is an implicit understanding of these terms, no research has quantified what distinguishes one sourcing configuration from another or what institutional factors contribute to the pursuit of one strategy over the other. We leverage institutional theory to examine how key organizational antecedents such as strategic orientation (mission), formal structure (size), and internal dynamics (patient case mix complexity) influence the rate at which organizations move toward or away from a single-sourcing configuration. Employing longitudinal modeling combined with sequence analysis techniques, we empirically evaluate IS sourcing strategies of nearly all U.S. hospitals operating continuously over a 9-year time frame from 2005 to 2013. We find that hospitals are generally trending toward a single-sourcing configuration and that formal structure and internal dynamics serve as predictors of this trend. Contrary to the predictions of institutional theory, we find that strategic orientation is not predictive of IS sourcing strategy. These results have important implications for research and practice. Notably, we are the first to quantify sourcing strategies, and, by doing so, are able to inform practitioners and academics of the key organizational characteristics that lead hospitals to move more quickly toward single-sourcing configurations."

We explore the factors associated with duplicate tests when patients utilize healthcare services from multiple providers, and yet information sharing across these providers is fragmented. We hypothesize that implementation of health information sharing technologies will reduce the duplication rate more for radiology tests compared to laboratory tests, especially when health information sharing technologies are implemented across disparate provider organizations. We utilize a unique panel data set consisting of 39,600 patient visits from 2005 to 2012, across outpatient clinics of 68 hospitals, to test our hypotheses. We apply a quasi-experimental approach to investigate the impact of health information sharing technologies on the duplicate testing rate. Our results indicate that usage of information sharing technologies across health organizations is associated with lower duplication rates, and the extent of reduction in duplicate tests is more pronounced among radiology tests compared to laboratory tests.

This would alleviate the computational cost for extracting features on each individual tweet. On the other hand, much information on the population could be lost as the distribution of textual features of a population could be important for identifying the health index of that population. In addition, there could be relationships between features and those relationships could also convey predictive information of the health index. In this paper, we propose mid-level features namely kernel-based features for prediction of health indices of populations from social media data. The kernel-based features are extracted on the distributions of textual features over population tweets and encode the relationships between individual textual features in a kernel function. We implemented our features using three different kernel functions and applied them for two case studies of population health prediction: across-year prediction and across-county prediction. The kernel-based features were evaluated and compared with existing features on a dataset collected from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System dataset. Experimental results show that the kernel-based features gained significantly higher prediction performance than existing techniques, by up to 16.3%, suggesting the potential and applicability of the proposed features in a wide spectrum of applications on data analytics at population levels. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."

Organizations are under great pressure to use information systems effectively but they have few theories to turn to for insights. Motivated by this need, we propose an approach for developing context-specific theories of effective use. The approach suggests that effective use can be theorized by: (1) understanding how a network of affordances supports the achievement of organizational goals, (2) understanding how the affordances are actualized, and (3) using inductive theorizing to elaborate these principles in a given context.We demonstrate the approach in the context of a Canadian health authority's use of a community-care electronic healthcare record (EHR). We discovered that effective use in this context can be viewed at a high level as the accuracy and consistency with which users work with the EHR, and how they engage in reflection-in-action across a network of nine affordances. The key, however, is understanding how those elements interact with the multiple levels of data needed to achieve the organization's various goals. Overall, we contribute by offering an approach for developing context-specific theories of effective use, demonstrating its usefulness in an important context, and discovering the importance of understanding in a new way the multilevel nature of information systems. © 2017 INFORMS."

We then propose that symbolic and substantive adoption will moderate the effect that IT security investments have on reducing the incidence of data security breaches over time. Using data from three different sources, we create a matched panel of over 5,000 U.S. hospitals and 938 breaches over the 2005-2013 time frame. Using a growth mixture model approach to model the heterogeneity in likelihood of breach, we use a two class solution in which hospitals that (1) belong to smaller health systems, (2) are older, (3) smaller in size, (4) for-profit, (5) non-academic, (6) faith-based, and (7) less entrepreneurial with IT are classified as symbolic adopters. We find that symbolic adoption diminishes the effectiveness of IT security investments, resulting in an increased likelihood of breach. Contrary to our theorizing, the use of more IT security is not directly responsible for reducing breaches, but instead, institutional factors create the conditions under which IT security investments can be more effective. Implications of these findings are significant for policy and practice, the most important of which may be the discovery that firms need to consider how adoption is influenced by institutional factors and how this should be balanced with technological solutions. In particular, our results support the notion that deeper integration of security into IT-related processes and routines leads to fewer breaches, with the caveat that it takes time for these benefits to be realized."

Information systems researchers have differing views on this, some emphasizing the strengths of the generic and others the importance of contextual aspects. Contributing to this debate, Pollock and Williams have coined the term generification in order to describe how large vendors succeed in globalizing software packages through management by community, content and social authority. In this paper, we explore an approach that we call open generification, which extends Pollock and Williams' work in the sense that we acknowledge the need for and the feasibility of generic software, but propose an alternative model for the governance of it. Open generification is not about managing the community of users attached to a software package by homogenization or segmentation but aims at addressing the diverse needs of the community the software is expected to serve. Our empirical basis is a longitudinal study of the development of an open-source health information system software (District Health Information software version 2), which is being used in more than 47 countries. Its success is attributed to a continuous interplay between generic and specific software and continuous cycles of embedding (implementing the global in the local context) and disembedding (taking local innovations into the global).

The proposed framework is evaluated using a case study of a regional health plan. A Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) instantiates the framework and enables decision makers to explore physician shortage areas.

Heavyweight IT denotes the well-established knowledge regime of large systems, developing ever more sophisticated solutions through advanced integration. Lightweight IT is suggested as a term for the new knowledge regime of mobile apps, sensors and bring-your-own-device, also called consumerisation and Internet-of-Things. The key aspect of lightweight IT is not only the cheaper and more available technology compared with heavyweight IT, but the fact that its deployment is frequently done by users or vendors, bypassing the IT departments. Our theoretical lens is generativity, the idea that complex phenomena arise from interactions among basic elements. In the context of IT, generativity helps to explain the creative potential of flexible digital technology for knowledgeable professionals and users. The research questions are: how is generativity different in heavyweight and lightweight IT, and what is the generative relationship between heavyweight and lightweight IT? These questions were investigated through a study of four cases in the health sector. Our findings show that (i) generativity enfolds differently in heavyweight and lightweight IT and (ii) generativity in digital infrastructures is supported by the interaction of loosely coupled heavyweight and lightweight IT. The practical design implication is that heavyweight and lightweight IT should be only loosely integrated, both in terms of technology, standardisation and organisation. © 2016 JIT Palgrave Macmillan All rights reserved."

Healthcare predictive analytics using electronic health records offers a promising direction to address the challenging tasks of risk profiling. Patients with chronic diseases often face risks of not just one, but an array of adverse health events. However, existing risk models typically focus on one specific event and do not predict multiple outcomes. To attain enhanced risk profiling, we adopt the design science paradigm and propose a principled approach called Bayesian multitask learning (BMTL). Considering the model development for an event as a single task, our BMTL approach is to coordinate a set of baseline models-one for each event-and communicate training information across the models. The BMTL approach allows healthcare providers to achieve multifaceted risk profiling and model an arbitrary number of events simultaneously. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that the BMTL approach attains an improved predictive performance when compared with the alternatives that model multiple events separately. We also find that, in most cases, the BMTL approach significantly outperforms existing multitask learning techniques. More importantly, our analysis shows that the BMTL approach can create significant potential impacts on clinical practice in reducing the failures and delays in preventive interventions. We discuss several implications of this study for health IT, big data and predictive analytics, and design science research."

Recent arguments claim that most information systems (IS) research has taken a limited theoretical focus on the information technology (IT) artifact, which arguably should be at the core of the IS discipline (Benbasat & Zmud, 2003). This research engages directly with the IT artifact by evaluating the use of an electronic medical records system and its relation to actualization of technology affordances. We conducted a case study at a large urban acute care hospital in the Midwestern United States with registered nurses working on inpatient care units as the clinicians of interest. Through interviews with nurses and other clinical stakeholders, observation of nurse's work practices on three patient care units in the hospital, and direct examination of the medical records system, we develop theoretical insights into the role of IT in work practices. The novel concept of affordance potency is introduced as an integral theoretical construct in our model of affordances, helping to explain actualizations of IT in use.

We analyze seven years of panel data from 1236 healthcare firms and present empirical evidence supporting our hypothesis. When our finding is combined with extant research, it becomes reasonable to propose that unidirectional causality does not fully describe the process of IT business value creation. Instead, we argue that existing static models of IT business value with unidirectional causality can be recast as dynamic models that explicitly incorporate multiple time periods and a positive feedback relationship to more accurately capture the complexity of this process. The creation of IT business value can thus be understood as a positive feedback model where IT investment in a given time period builds the stock of IT inputs, where those IT inputs then impact productivity, and where productivity leads to IT investment in a future time period, beginning the cycle anew. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."

The notion of professional capital, as a set of renewable resources for social professionals developed by good education within a territory of social practice, is introduced to understand the unique resources available to doctors for social exchange. Specifically, we examine the effects of status capital and decisional capital (two dimensions of professional capital) on doctors’ social and economic returns. Moreover, we explore how such effects differ across different doctor groups.

In this study, we examine health information technology (HIT) that is electronically integrated across care physicians, specialists, hospitals, and pharmacists and its impact on quality of care. Drawing on the structure–process–outcome framework, we hypothesize that integrated HIT will have both a direct and an indirect effect on quality of care. By providing more complete information to physicians and allowing them to detect and manage health problems early in the care cycle, integrated HIT is expected to directly improve quality of care. Integrated HIT is also hypothesized to improve quality of care indirectly by increasing continuity of care and reducing the odds of therapeutic errors. We test these hypotheses through a contemporaneous natural experiment of a matched set of 15,626 outpatients receiving ambulatory care through an integrated HIT system and 15,626 outpatients in a control group. The results show that the patients treated with the integrated system had better quality of care in the follow-up period than patients of the control group. Integrated HIT also had an indirect effect on quality of care through an increase in continuity of care. Our study contributes to research by examining how an integrated HIT system—rather than specific HIT components—influences patient-related outcomes, and how this effect is mediated by two key processes: continuity of care and therapeutic duplication errors.

Data mining models can be used to effectively analyze and extract novel information from large/complex transplantation datasets. The objective of this study is to predict the 1-, 5-, and 9-year patient's graft survival following a heart transplant surgery via the deployment of analytical models that are based on four powerful classification algorithms (i.e. decision trees, artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and logistic regression). Since the datasets used in this study has a much larger number of survival cases than deaths for 1- and 5-year survival analysis and vice versa for 9-year survival analysis, random under sampling (RUS) and synthetic minority over-sampling (SMOTE) are employed to overcome the data-imbalance problems. The results indicate that logistic regression combined with SMOTE achieves the best classification for the 1-, 5-, and 9-year outcome prediction, with area-under-the-curve (AUC) values of 0.624, 0.676, and 0.838, respectively. By applying sensitivity analysis to the data analytical models, the most important predictors and their associated contribution for the 1-, 5-, and 9-year graft survival of heart transplant patients are identified.

The extant studies on organisational privacy compliance concentrate on the extent to which privacy threats can be alleviated through a combination of technical and human controls and the positive (and often intended) influences of these controls. This focus inadvertently neglects unintended consequences such as impeded workflow in medical practices. To address this research conflict, this study uses an interpretive grounded theory research approach to investigate the consequences of privacy safeguard enactment in medical practices, including whether it influences their ability to meet privacy requirements and whether workflows are impeded. Our central contribution is a theoretical framework, the unintended consequences of privacy safeguard enactment (UCPSE) framework, which explicates the process by which privacy safeguards are evaluated and subsequently bypassed and the resulting influence on organisational compliance. The UCPSE highlights the importance of the imbalance challenge, which is the result of unintended consequences outweighing the intended consequences of privacy safeguard enactment. Failure to address the imbalance challenge leads to the adoption of workarounds that may ultimately harm the organisation's privacy compliance. Despite several research calls, the consequences and effectiveness of organisational privacy efforts are largely missing from both information systems and health informatics research.

In this paper, we provide a systematic understanding of the mechanisms through which various actors translate competing visions about health sector reforms into policy and action and, thus, generate contradictions in IS innovation. We argue that we can learn more about the source of such contradictions by examining how competing frames can affect IS innovation in healthcare. We adopt frame theory and rhetorical strategies analysis in the case of health sector reforms in Kenya and focus specifically on the deployment of health information systems (HIS). We make several contributions. First, we demonstrate that policy actors’ adherence to the interests and values represented in a frame is important in determining the choice of a rhetorical strategy and its influence on policy transformation and IS innovation. Second, we develop an understanding of how technology mediates the rhetorical strategies of different actors. In particular, we demonstrate the role of technology in giving continuity to frames, which affects policy change and IS innovation. © 2017 by the Association for Information Systems."

To do so, they converse with other individuals in platforms such as public discussion boards and blogs. During these online conversations, people may communicate their personal health information (PHI) to others. A potential driver for this form of revealing PHI is the immediate positive outcomes that it can provide for contributors and the community. PHI disclosure, however, can entail privacy risks and concerns for community members, which may ultimately hamper their participation in those communities. Moreover, one’s emotional attachment to a VHC (namely, affective commitment) may influence one’s PHI sharing behaviors in that community. Thus, to understand how various factors impact communicating PHI in public VHC discussions, we drew on the privacy calculus model and the notion of affective commitment, developed a theoretical model, and empirically tested the model. To do so, we administered a survey to individuals from three different populations including students, faculty, and staff at a large university and visitors to clinics. We performed a set of hierarchical moderated multiple regressions on the dataset. The results revealed that privacy concerns along with expected personal and community-related outcomes of communicating PHI affected willingness to communicate PHI in public VHC discussions. The results, however, refuted the hypothesized direct and moderating effects of affective commitment on willingness to share PHI in these virtual platforms.

Turkey - a developing country - has undergone a major healthcare transformation marked by the redesign of primary care delivery and the implementation of a nation-wide Electronic Health Records (EHR) system. In this research, presenting Turkey's case, we investigate the consequences of EHR implementation in developing countries. We argue that to better understand the consequences, we need to link macro-level healthcare goals with micro-level system usage behaviors that actualize the macro-level goals or alternatively result in unintended negative health outcomes. We posit that this linkage is achieved through the meso-level structures, namely the EHR and the organizational context, in which it is embedded. Hence, we examine the EHR's role in this relationship. Our findings indicate that EHR usage both enables and constrains the achievement of clinicians' professional goals in the context of primary care delivery. Moreover, goal alignment between the government agency as the designer of the system and the clinicians influence the outcomes of the EHR-enabled transformation. When the healthcare goals are aligned, the system enables the clinicians to achieve their professional goals and their system usage behaviors converge, contributing to improvements in health outcomes. Contrarily, when the goals are misaligned, the system constrains goal achievement and the clinicians show divergent usage behaviors, including goal abandonment. In turn, goal abandonment may lead to negative consequences and even adversely affect the achievement of population-level healthcare goals in the long run. © 2016 Association for Information Technology Trust."

While generating great expectations, these projects remain poorly documented and available data suggest high failure rates. This raises a practical question: How are such eHealth networks to be effectively designed and implemented? This paper addresses this question. Specifically, it presents an ethnographic study of the Pan-African e-Network, a project which connects many hospitals all across India and Africa, providing medical teleconsultations and distance learning services. The study investigates the low utilisation of the network, an issue undermining its potential and efficiency. Factors contributing to this situation include communication barriers, the presumed ego of doctors, poor awareness of the project, and a lack of flexibility to work with the specificities of the connected sites. Above all, these factors point towards a dichotomous approach across the project's design and implementation, and taking two distinct yet related forms: (a) an ontological divide between technical and 'non-technical' domains; (b) a political sorting out of what is and what is not the project, aimed at neutralising and accounting for heterogeneous processes and practices. In both cases, low utilisation reveals tensions between processes of closure and control, and the openness of a life that will not be contained. Ultimately, this paper intends to destabilise binary modes of thinking as they crystallise oppositions between design and implementation, project and context, technical and social worlds, efficacy and improvisation, mastery and unruliness, map and territory. © 2016 Association for Information Technology Trust."

We propose a new conceptualization of user abilities, task-specific user capabilities, and examine their compensatory effects with technology capabilities in shaping performance outcomes within the context of e-consultations (i.e., technology-mediated expert consultations). Specifically, we theorize the user capabilities of presentation (information giving) and elicitation (information seeking) as the task-specific user capabilities in this context. Leveraging the theory of compensatory adaptation, we propose that these user capabilities can overcome the limitations of technology and result in successful task performance outcomes. We employ mixed methods (qualitative field study, survey field study, and a lab experiment) to develop and test our model within the context of telemedicine consultations, a form of e-consultation. Convergent findings across the studies suggest that both user capabilities and technology capabilities are important facilitators of task performance and that these capabilities compensate for each other."

Data sharing in healthcare remains a challenge due to widespread privacy concerns. Despite abundant research in privacy preserving data mining, healthcare organizations are unwilling to release their medical data on account of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires protecting the confidentiality and security of healthcare data. Further, sensitive data spanning multiple organizations result in not only the data syntax and semantic heterogeneity but also diverse privacy requirements, posing additional challenges to data sharing and integration. In overcoming these challenges, a multi-agent approach is a viable alternative.

Using the social exchange theory, we propose a benefit vs. cost knowledge sharing model for OHCs. The benefits are mainly based on Maslow's hierarchy of needs, and the cost includes cognitive and executional costs. We use this benefit vs. cost model to examine how OHC members share general and specific knowledge. Data were collected from 323 users of two well-known OHCs in China and were analyzed using the structural equation model. The results demonstrate that three factors positively impact the sharing of both general and specific knowledge: a sense of self-worth, members’ perceived social support, and reputation enhancement. Another factor, face concern, has a negative influence on specific knowledge sharing and a positive influence on general knowledge sharing. Executional cost only negatively impacts general knowledge sharing, and cognitive cost only negatively impacts specific knowledge sharing. This study of OHCs reveals that personal benefits promote knowledge sharing and costs prohibit it. These impacts vary between general knowledge and specific knowledge sharing. © 2016"

We find that, under certain conditions low-gain HPs choose not to join HIEs. Hence, we explore several measures that can encourage more participation in these networks and find that it might be beneficial to (i) establish a second HIE in the region, (ii) propose more value to the low-gain HPs, or (iii) offer or incentivize value-added services.

Given the powerful information dissemination capabilities, information and communication technologies (ICTs) have been suggested as interventions to build infant care awareness and to modify healthcare behaviors. We examine how the use of one ICT intervention-specifically, eHealth kiosks disseminating authenticated and accessible medical information-can alleviate the problem of high infant mortality in rural India. We investigate how mothers' social networks affect their use of eHealth kiosks, seeking professional medical care for their infants and, ultimately, infant mortality. Drawing on the social epidemiology and social networks literatures, we focus on advice and hindrance from both strong and weak ties as the conduit of social influence on mothers' health-related behaviors for the care of their infants. Over a period of 7 years, we studied 4,620 infants across 10 villages where the eHealth kiosks were implemented along with support resources for proxy use. The results revealed that (1) eHealth kiosk use promotes seeking professional medical care and reduces infant mortality, (2) mothers are especially vulnerable to hindrance from both strong and weak ties as they choose to maintain the status quo of traditional infant healthcare practices (e.g., reliance on untrained personnel, superstitions, fatalism) in villages, and (3) advice from both strong and weak ties offers the potential to break down misplaced beliefs about infant healthcare practices and to develop literacy on seeking professional medical care. In contrast, in a comparative group of 10 neighboring villages, the reduction in infant mortality was not as pronounced and the effect of professional medical care in reducing infant mortality was lower. Our findings suggest that an ICT intervention can effectively address one of society's most important problems (i.e., infant mortality) even in parts of the world with limited resources and deep suspicion of technology and change. Overall, we believe such an ICT intervention will complement other investments being made, including the facilitation of use (proxy use) and provision of professional medical facilities to reduce infant mortality."

Recently information derived from news articles has become a part of financial predictive systems. The usage of news articles and their forecasting potential have been extensively researched. However, so far no attempts have been made to utilise different categories of news articles simultaneously. This paper studies how the concurrent, and appropriately weighted, usage of news articles, having different degrees of relevance to the target stock, can improve the performance of financial forecasting and support the decision-making process of investors and traders. Stock price movements are predicted using the multiple kernel learning technique which integrates information extracted from multiple news categories while separate kernels are utilised to analyse each category. News articles are partitioned according to their relevance to the target stock, its sub-industry, industry, group industry and sector.

As electronic health data are increasingly available today, there is a unique opportunity to implement real-time decision support systems for automating the surveillance of healthcare-associated infections. As a consequence, different electronic surveillance systems have been implemented to date with varying degrees of success. However, there have been few instances in which clinical data and physician narratives with the potential to significantly improve electronic surveillance alternatives have been adopted. In this context, the present work introduces a case-based reasoning system for the automatic surveillance and diagnosis of healthcare-associated infections. The developed system makes use of different machine learning techniques in order to (i) automatically extract evidence from different types of data including clinical unstructured documents, (ii) incorporate static a priori knowledge handled by infection preventionists, and (iii) dynamically generate new knowledge as well as understandable explanations about the system's decisions. Results obtained from a real deployment in a public hospital belonging to the Spanish National Health System trained with 2569 samples belonging to 1800 patients during more than 10 consecutive months recognize the usefulness of the system. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

While research has begun to document the economic outcomes associated with online communities, quantifying the social value created in these collectives has been largely overlooked. This study proposes that online health communities create social value by addressing rural-urban health disparities via improved health capabilities. Using a unique data set from a rare disease community, we provide one of the first empirical studies of social value creation. Our quantitative analysis using exponential random graph models reveals patterns of social support exchanged between users and the variations in these patterns based on users' location. We find that, overall, urban users are net suppliers of social support while rural participants are net recipients, suggesting that technology-mediated online health communities are able to alleviate rural-urban health disparities. This study advances extant understanding of value production in online collectives, and yields implications for policy."

Rational addicts anticipate the future consequences of their current behaviors and attempt to maximize utility from their intertemporal consumption choices. Conversely, myopic addicts tend toward immediate gratification and fail to fully recognize the future consequences of their current consumption. In lieu of conducting self-report surveys or aggregatelevel demand estimation, this research examines addictive behaviors on the basis of consumption quantity at an individual level. To empirically validate rational addiction in the context of social app consumption, we collect and analyze 13-month, individual-level panel data on the weekly app usage of thousands of smartphone users. Results indicate that the average social app user conducts herself in a forward-looking manner and rationally adjusts consumption over time to derive optimal utility. The subgroup analysis, however, indicates that substantial variations in addictiveness and forward-looking propensities exist across demographically diverse groups. For example, addictive behaviors toward social network sites are more myopic in nature among older, less-educated, high-income groups. Additionally, the type of social app moderates the effects of demographic characteristics on the nature of addictive behaviors. We provide implications that policymakers can use to effectively manage mobile addiction problems, with the recommendations focusing on asymmetric social policies (e.g., information- and capacity-enhancing measures). © 2016 INFORMS."

Since there are many different definitions of the concepts of champion and champion behaviour in the literature, practitioners and researchers may be confused about how to exactly use these concepts. A qualitative analysis of a single case study in a Swedish health-care organisation enabled us to explain how different champion behaviours relate to each other and how multiple champions interact. Combining our rich case observations with an analysis of champion literature reveals how champion behaviours form a coherent and meaningful whole in which networks of different types of champions at different levels in an organisation utilise their network of relations, their knowledge of the organisation and their insight into strategic decision-making politics to time and orchestrate the framing of innovations and the involvement of the right people. In conclusion, championing is a complex performance of contextually dependent collective social interaction, varying over time, rather than a heroic act of one individual promoting an idea. Future studies need to focus more on how the relations between different champions and their behaviours develop across innovations and over time, in order to develop a richer understanding of championing. © 2016 Operational Research Society Ltd."

However, the concept of Patient-Centred Care (PCC) and the role of IT in the transformation of healthcare are not straightforward. Their meanings need unpacking in order to reveal assumptions behind different visions and their implications for IT-enabled healthcare transformation. To this end, this paper reviews literature on PCC and IT and analyses England's health policy between 1989 and 2013. English policy has set out to transform healthcare from organization-centric to patient-centred and has placed IT as central to this process. This policy vision is based on contested conceptualizations of PCC. IT implementation is problematic and this is at least partly because of the underpinning goals and visions of healthcare policy. If this misalignment is not addressed then producing technologically superior systems, or better IT implementation strategies, is unlikely to result in widespread and substantial changes to the way healthcare is delivered and experienced. For IT to support a healthcare service that is truly patient-centred, patients' needs and wants need to be identified and designed into IT-enabled services rather than simply added on afterwards. © 2016 Operational Research Society Ltd."

Our findings suggest that favorable and unfavorable positions held by multiple stakeholder groups become entangled and that even the same focal group may adopt competing positions that undermine the adoption of the health network. As this situation develops, the policy and implementation of the broader health IT program becomes confused and destabilized. This study makes three contributions. First, it expands the literature on stakeholder theory in the IS domain. Second, it extends the managerial focus of stakeholder approaches to include policymaking in the diverse multi- stakeholder setting of healthcare. Third, it demonstrates how IS research can employ stakeholder analysis by adopting a broader, dynamic approach to identify different stakeholder groups and by focusing on their varied roles and views during the course of a large-scale health IT program. © 2016 by the Association for Information Systems."

In this unsustainable situation, revenue cycle management (RCM), the business process that drives revenue collection and accounts receivable administration, becomes increasingly crucial for healthcare organizations. RCM is at the center of an incredibly complex network of external and internal links, and its success chiefly depends on a smooth flow of timely, accurate information. While IS research increasingly focuses on clinical health information technologies (HITs), IT’s potential as an enabler of hospitals’ administrative activities remains by and large unexplored. To advance research into administrative HIT, we draw on Pettigrew’s (1987, 1990) theoretical contextualist framework of organizational transformation. Contextualist inquiry is particularly well suited to the study of complex organizational change processes, and it affords a comprehensive view on the opportunities and challenges involved in transforming IT-enabled RCM. Leveraging these strengths, we review the diverse body of academic literature related to RCM transformation and juxtapose the findings with the prevalent discourse in practitioner publications on RCM. These analyses reveal major gaps between extant theory and the problems faced in practice.

These individuals are, therefore, believed to pose a risk of violence to themselves as well as to other individuals. Assessing and managing the risk of violence is considered to be a critical component for discharged decision making in MSS. Methods for violence risk assessment in this area of research are typically based on regression models or checklists with no statistical composition and which naturally demonstrate mediocre predictive performance and, more importantly, without providing genuine decision support. While Bayesian networks have become popular tools for decision support in the medical field over the last couple of decades, they have not been extensively studied in forensic psychiatry. In this paper, we describe a decision support system using Bayesian networks, which is mainly parameterised based on questionnaire, interviewing and clinical assessment data, for violence risk assessment and risk management in patients discharged from MSS. The results demonstrate moderate to significant improvements in forecasting capability. More importantly, we demonstrate how decision support is improved over the well-established approaches in this area of research, primarily by incorporating causal interventions and taking advantage of the model's ability in answering complex probabilistic queries for unobserved variables. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Among these, the rational and anarchical models have emerged as important representations of decision-making dynamics. The rational model and its variants of decision making emphasize recognized phases and sequence among them, while anarchical models focus on the lack of structure and sequence in many real-world decision-making contexts. In order to observe the existence of these phases and their sequence, it is critical to choose non-trivial situations in which the underlying dynamics of decision-making process are readily visible. To this end, we consider decision-making (DM) in Health Online Social Networks (HOSN) and verify the existence of recognized phases and the sequence in which these phases are reached. We use netnography to explore the potential of HOSN as a support tool for decision-making process. Our results confirm, extend, as well as challenge existing knowledge. Results confirm that HOSN support and empower users during their decision-making process in three specific key phases that include Intelligence, Design and Choice. We extend existing knowledge by suggesting two new phases in the decision making process that is integral to HOSN conversations, namely emotional support and sharing experiences. Our results challenge purely rational and anarchical models by recognizing the interweaving of anarchical decision sequences within the structure of rational decision making phases.

Although prior research has shown that diagnostic and treatment recommendations might be altered based on the severity of comorbidities, chronic diseases are still being investigated in isolation from one another in most cases. To illustrate the significance of concurrent chronic diseases in the course of treatment, this study uses SEER's cancer data to create two comorbid data sets: one for breast and female genital cancers and another for prostate and urinal cancers. Several popular machine learning techniques are then applied to the resultant data sets to build predictive models. Comparison of the results shows that having more information about comorbid conditions of patients can improve models' predictive power, which in turn, can help practitioners make better diagnostic and treatment decisions. Therefore, proper identification, recording, and use of patients' comorbidity status can potentially lower treatment costs and ease the healthcare related economic challenges. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To account for the critical role of regulation in healthcare, senior managers' reliance on each of these four search mechanisms is hypothesized to be contingent upon their hospital's regulative legitimacy. Analyses of panel data from all 153 public nonspecialist hospital organizations in England reveal that hospital managers invest in IS not only to find solutions to performance shortfalls (problemistic search), but also to achieve continuity and predictability in resource allocation (institutionalized search) and signal conformity with external norms and expectations (mimetic search). We find that the desire to make adequate use of uncommitted financial resources (slack search) is salient only among hospitals with low levels of regulative legitimacy. These new insights into the motives that trigger- and constrain-senior managers' IS investment decisions will help IS managers to strengthen their case for IS investment and guide policy makers in how best to allocate resources to IS in healthcare and possibly beyond."

This is expected to enhance their digital capabilities and thus to have a positive influence on the digital outcomes (or services) experienced. In contrast, this study is anchored in an alternative service-dominant logic and posits that viewing the divide from a service perspective might be better suited to the context of developing countries, where there is a huge divide across societal segments in accessing basic services such as healthcare and education. This research views the prevailing differences in the level of services consumed by different population segments (service divide) as the key issue to be addressed by innovative digital tools in developing countries. The study posits that information and communication technologies (ICTs) can be leveraged to bridge the service divide to enhance the capabilities of service-disadvantaged segments of society. But such service delivery requires an innovative assembly of ICT as well as non-ICT resources. Building on concepts from service-dominant logic and service science, this paper aims to understand how such service innovation efforts can be orchestrated. Specifically, adopting a process view, two Indian enterprises that have developed sustainable telemedicine healthcare service delivery models for the rural population in India are examined. The study traces the configurations of three interactional resources-knowledge, technology, and institutions-through which value-creating usercentric objectives of increasing geographical access and reducing cost are achieved. The theoretical contributions are largely associated with unearthing and understanding how the three interactional resources were orchestrated for service-centric value creation in different combinative patterns as resource exploitation, resource combination, and value reinforcement. The analysis also reveals the three distinct stages of service innovation evolution (idea and launch, infancy and early growth, and late growth and expansion), with a distinct shift in the dominant resource for each stage. Through an inductive process, the study also identifies four key enablers for successfully implementing these ICT-enabled service innovations: obsessive customer empathy, belief in the transformational power of ICT, continuous recursive learning, and efficient network orchestration."

Research, though, has yet to consider the association of consumer perceived value with digital service business models underlying technological innovations. We seek to demonstrate that consumer value for digital service business models may be quite different even when consumers have similar preferences for standard technology characteristics. In the context of this paper, we specifically consider consumer perceived value associated with Personal Health Records (PHRs) and PHR digital business models, through the use of an integrated latent variable and choice empirical model. We find that although consumer perceived value for PHRs is generally high, when offered a choice between three competing PHR business models, consumers state high value for only two of the business models in the choice set: PHRs offered directly by groups of medical providers and Integrated PHRs. These findings suggest that while perceived value may be high for generally considered digital services, variations in the underlying digital service business models are likely to have significant impacts on consumer valuations of digital services. © 2015 Operational Research Society Ltd."

We propose that acquisition value can be created when an acquirer redeploys its digital resources to its newly acquired businesses and consequently improves their operations. However, not all acquirers are equally capable of redeploying their digital resources. In this study, we propose two enabling factors pertaining to an acquirer's IT resource base: IT extensiveness and IT standardization. We argue that the magnitude of digital resource redeployment increases when the acquirer has had extensive use of IT systems within its existing business units and has standardized IT systems across its business units. Moreover, the relative strength of the IT resources of the acquirer, as compared to those of the acquired business, also affects the reuse of the acquirer's IT resources in its digital resource redeployment activities. We empirically test these hypotheses by tracking the IT and performance changes in 108 U.S. hospitals before and after they were acquired across a seven-year study timeframe. © 2015 INFORMS."

Nevertheless, little attention has been paid to how these networks are formed. In this paper, we examine the driving forces behind patients' social network formation and evolution. We argue that patients' health-related traits influence their social connections and that the patients' network layout is shaped by their cognitive capabilities and their network embeddedness. By studying longitudinal data from 1,322 individuals and their communication ties in an online healthcare social network, we find that firsthand disease experience, which provides knowledge of the disease, increases the probability that patients will find experientially similar others and establish communication ties. Patients' cognitive abilities, including the information load that they can process and the range of social ties that they can manage, however, limit their network growth. In addition, we find that patients' efforts to reach out for additional social resources are associated with their embeddedness in the network and the cost of maintaining connections.

This paper studies II formation processes and their outcomes; namely, II architecture and distribution of control rights. We conduct an in-depth exploratory case study of an electronic prescription II and report on two formation processes: stratification and mesh working. The stratification process in our case study involved classifying the IIs’ diverse socio-technical components into homogeneous groups and consolidating them into a coherent hierarchical structure that standardized the components’ behavior. The outcome of this stratification was a dual and hierarchical architecture and a fairly centralized locus of control. The mesh working process, by contrast, assembled heterogeneous components without homogenizing them; the components were distributed in a way that enabled them to self-organize. The outcome of this mesh working process was a modular architecture that decoupled the central nodes from the users’ installed base and a more decentralized structure. Consequently, the final II architecture was a hybrid offering both centralized control and autonomy of the parts. Our research further illustrates how this architecture then influenced the project’s complexity and the actors’ position in the sector.

We draw on psychology to argue that in situations where there is a wide variance in actual IT knowledge, there will often exist a U-shaped relationship between actual and self-perceived IT knowledge such that the least knowledgeable believe themselves to be highly knowledgeable. We then draw on individual-level adoption theories to argue that users with high self-perceived IT knowledge will be more likely to adopt new technologies and do so faster. We also draw on individual-level continuance theories to argue that users with low actual IT knowledge will be more likely to discontinue using new technologies and do so faster.

However, the potential of an HIE platform can only be realized when its multiple constituent users actively participate in using its variety of services. In this research, we model HIE systems as multisided platforms that incorporate self-service technologies whose value to the users depends on both user-specific and network-specific factors. We develop a model of adoption, use, and involvement of clinical practices in the coproduction of the HIE services. This model is grounded in social network theory, service operations theory, and institutional isomorphism theory. A longitudinal study of actual adoption and use behaviors of 2,054 physicians within 430 community medical practices in Western New York over a three-year period has been carried out to evaluate the proposed model. This study has been supported by HEALTHeLINK, the Regional Health Information Organization of Western New York, which has an extensive database comprising over half a million transactions on patient records by the HIE users. We extracted panel data on adoption, use, and service coproduction behaviors from this database and carried out a detailed analysis using metrics derived from the foundational theories. Positioning practices within two distinct but interrelated networks of patients and practitioners, we show that adoption, use, and service coproduction behaviors are influenced by the topographies of the two networks, isomorphic effects of large practices on the smaller ones, and practice labor inputs in HIE use. Our findings provide a comprehensive view of the drivers of HIE adoption and use at the level of medical practices.

We identify two possible solutions proposed in the literature, one emphasizing more top-down control and the need for a clear IT governance framework, and a second arguing for a more flexible approach since absolute control is impossible and only leads to drift and unintended outcomes. We suggest that there is a clear gap in the literature in better understanding how to govern the development of information infrastructures using a bottom-up approach. We build on research that approaches IS development as a collective action problem and focus on how different actors frame the infrastructure as a public and private good, and how the framing process is underpinned by actors' different ideologies. We use our theoretical approach to examine the framing of the development of a regional health information infrastructure in Crete. Our analysis examines how different actors frame the infrastructure as a collective action good and explore their ideological positioning. We explore the struggle around meanings attributed to the good over time as being a public or private one in establishing or sustaining relations of power, and how legitimacy is challenged or reinforced.

Toward this end, we develop a novel, predictive analytics model, termed as the beta geometric Erlang-2 (BG/EG) hurdle model, which predicts the propensity, frequency, and timing of readmissions of patients diagnosed with congestive heart failure (CHF). This unified model enables us to answer three key questions related to the use of predictive analytics methods for patient readmissions: whether a readmission will occur, how often readmissions will occur, and when a readmission will occur. We test our model using a unique data set that tracks patient demographic, clinical, and administrative data across 67 hospitals in North Texas over a four-year period. We show that our model provides superior predictive performance compared to extant models such as the logit, BG/NBD hurdle, and EG hurdle models. Our model also allows us to study the association between hospital usage of health information technologies (IT) and readmission risk. We find that health IT usage, patient demographics, visit characteristics, payer type, and hospital characteristics, are significantly associated with patient readmission risk. We also observe that implementation of cardiology information systems is associated with a reduction in the propensity and frequency of future readmissions, whereas administrative IT systems are correlated with a lower frequency of future readmissions. Our results indicate that patient profiles derived from our model can serve as building blocks for a predictive analytics system to identify CHF patients with high readmission risk. © 2015, INFORMS."

We propose a research framework in which the absorptive capacity of a potential adopter and the collective disseminative capacity of connected adopters act as two key determinants of knowledge transfer in a socioeconomic network, and these two capacities substitute for each other in affecting HIT adoption. We also propose that, in a network setting, the mechanism of knowledge transfer manifests quite differently from that of social contagion in its impact on the diffusion process at different stages of adoption. Using a large longitudinal data set covering adoption decisions of more than five thousand hospitals across a thirteen-year horizon, we find strong support for our hypotheses. Our analysis shows that knowledge flow in provider networks plays a key role in fostering technology diffusion in initial years, allowing the contagion effect to set in sooner for quicker adoption in later years.

Coupling that result with the economics of breach disclosure, we also show that proactive investments are more cost effective in healthcare security than reactive investments. Our results further indicate that this effect is amplified at the state level, supporting the argument that security investments create positive externalities. We also find that external pressure decreases the effect of proactive investments on security performance. This implies that proactive investments, voluntarily made, have more impact than those involuntarily made.

Some of the same factors that have driven delays in realizing the benefits from IT investments in other industries (i.e., time consuming process changes) are apparent in the U.S. healthcare industry, which is only now digitizing its fundamental patient data, the electronic health record. The healthcare industry itself is in transition and new IT may not provide full benefit unless it is accompanied with a restructuring of healthcare delivery. Traditional ex post approaches to measuring IT value will limit the ability of healthcare IT value researchers to add value to practice now especially as government incentives in the US drive significant investment. But generalizing results from traditional IT value research to the healthcare setting is risky due to differences between healthcare and other industries. I advocate for action design research that uses existing theory as a foundation, but adapts it to the specific unique characteristics of this industry. By actively participating in the design and evaluation of new socio-technical systems, IT value researchers can generate grounded theory to explain value creation in healthcare while influencing practice now. © 2014, Association for Information Systems.

In this paper, we propose a combined company-level and industry-level framework to shed light on the process of IIIS emergence. We demonstrate, for the first time, that IIIS emergence is intricately linked to the industry life cycle for the case of fragmented industries. We also explore the relationship between the industry-level and company-level life cycles in the process of IIIS emergence, and develop a novel proposition regarding this relationship.

These enhancements are then applied in the conceptual design of a mobile health alert generation and processing system. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed enhancements, we develop and utilize an analytical model. Using multiple metrics, including the number of alerts generated and probability of error in alert-response, we show that the proposed enhancements can improve the quality of mobile health.

Focusing on the critical realism (CR) and social constructionism (SC) philosophical approaches, it outlines the rationale for multi-ontological evaluation and develops principles for conducting it. The paper draws from experience of evaluating a national implementation program of electronic health records in hospitals, one of the projects of the English National Programme for IT. It argues that an evaluation based on SC and one based on CR are significantly different in how they use knowledge gained in the field, and in the kind of evidence and recommendations that they can offer policy makers. The CR philosophy applied to evaluation research provides foundations from which judgments and abstractions can be presented in the form expected by the policy makers and managers who commission evaluations. In line with its ontological standing, social constructionism cannot simply or directly abstract and generalize across contexts, though it can offer other types of valuable evaluative insight. We show that, despite their differences, these two philosophical positions can, when taken together, produce jointly useful knowledge. This paper argues for the use of multi-ontological evaluation approaches and provides guidelines for undertaking such endeavors by emphasizing the need for mutual respect, dialogue, negotiation, and reflection."

We take a fresh look at IT-associated organizational change using grounded theory methods. Our longitudinal study of an electronic health record (EHR) system implementation in a multi-site medical group found user behaviors that did not fit well with existing theories. Instead, we found that they fit better with the concept of affordances from ecological psychology. In developing our affordance-based theory of IT-associated organizational change from our field data, we discovered three gaps in the affordance literature; namely, the lack of theory for (1) the process of actualizing an affordance's potential, (2) affordances in an organizational context, and (3) bundles of interrelated affordances. This paper extends the theory of affordances to handle these three gaps and, in doing so, develops a mid-range theory for EHR-associated organizational change in a healthcare organization. While the resulting theory is specific to EHR implementations, it offers a template for other mid-range affordance-actualization theories and a more general affordance-actualization lens. Our affordance-actualization lens considers the materiality of the IT artifact, the non-deterministic process by which IT leads to organizational effects, the multilevel nature of IT-associated change processes, and the intentionality of managers and users as agents of change, and thus addresses important criteria for theories of IT effects in organizations. The paper also provides practical guidance for implementing EHR systems and other organizational systems."

However, agility studies have primarily focused on conceptual concerns, leaving these relationships empirically unexplored.

SEs are entrepreneurial organizations with a mission to improve complex social challenges (i.e., healthcare, hunger, education, etc) rather than profit maximization. This void leaves SEs in the dark as to how they can leverage IT to become more agile and improve performance. We draw on the agility perspective to examine how one exemplary SE operating in the context of pediatric global health utilized IT to enhance its agility and improve performance. We identify how the SE's IT-investment decisions resulted in an IT platform that facilitated increased agility in launching new products aimed at improving survival rates of children.

In accordance with the theory of reasoned action (TRA), this study aims to investigate the antecedents that influence nurses to use the PHIS, and to incorporate a framework of technology acceptance by individual professionals to improve the IT attitude in the health care setting. A total of 768 valid questionnaires were completed by primary health care nurses.

This paper analyzes a robust, panel style registration data set from 9 outpatient facilities consisting of 5 years of patients' attendance outcomes. The three outcomes, arrivals, cancellations prior to the scheduled appointment and failure to arrive (no-shows), distinguish this paper from prior empirical research that typically treats patient arrivals as a dichotomous outcome by grouping cancellations and no-shows together or excluding cancellations. Distinguishing cancellations from no-shows reveal different effects from patient age and appointment slot day and time. Findings focus on the variables having the greatest impact on attendance and conclude with the difficulty in predicting individual appointment outcomes and the observation that a rather small number of patients represent a disproportionately large percentage of no-shows. Four factors that have the greatest association with patient nonattendance are lead time (call appointment interval), financial payer (typically insurance provider), patient age, and the patient's prior attendance history. Lead time has the greatest impact and is the most addressable, whereas a patient's age, insurance provider and, to some extent, patient behavior cannot be altered.

Findings indicate that a majority of such information returned by popular search engines is of a high quality but quality levels vary across different health topic areas. In particular, searches for terms related to preventive health and social health issues tend to produce lower quality results than terms related to diagnosis and treatment of physical disease or injury. While the overall prevalence of high quality information is greater than that of low quality, the observed variance across health-related terms has important implications for consumers, policy makers, health information providers, and search engines. © 2012 Elsevier B.V."

In the healthcare industry, the decision to adopt RFID technology is a problem requiring a multi-criteria decision analysis that involves both qualitative and quantitative factors. The evaluation of this decision may be based on imprecise information or uncertain data. Furthermore, there can be significant dependence and feedbacks between the different criteria and alternatives. However, most conventional decision models cannot capture these complex interrelationships. As a result, in this study we develop a general evaluation framework for industry evaluation, improvement and adoption of RFID. We use a hybrid Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method known as DDANPV that combines DEMATEL (decision making trial and evaluation laboratory), DANP (DEMATEL-based ANP), and VIKOR to evaluate the factors that influence the adoption of RFID. Specifically, we study the adoption of RFID in Taiwan's healthcare industry.

In these rural areas, the challenges of healthcare quality are many, ranging from poor infrastructure, low literacy, poverty, to inadequate monitoring of patients with chronic or serious diseases. The myriad of challenges requires innovative solutions that are affordable, robust and sustainable over time. Furthermore, due to special characteristics of such rural areas and their inhabitants, any healthcare solution should embed a decision support mechanism to prevent basic medical errors and negligence. In this article, we first discuss a healthcare delivery model (home-based healthcare) in displaced rural areas of South Africa, and then we propose a patient monitoring system for supporting the model using Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) technology. The proposed system is decision support driven in that it supports medical staff (nurses, doctors) to decide on the course of intervention or further treatment based on the vital signs of the patients that are tele-monitored on a regular basis. This patient monitoring system facilitates patient information flow from home-based care workers to a local clinic or hospital, where the information is presented on a desktop computer used by clinic nurses and doctors for monitoring the patients' health and ultimately speeding up decision making. The proposed system is tested through a prototype, which is applied in practice and generates data for evaluation. © 2013 Elsevier B.V."

Based on archival panel data on costs, operations, and patient care outcomes of 66 hospitals in the U.S. state of Washington from 1998 to 2007, we find that past HIT expenditure is negatively associated with MIP, supporting our argument that HIT provides value that is anticipated by insurers and is captured by a change in MIP. We find that past HIT is positively associated with quality of patient care. We also find that past MIP is positively associated with quality of patient care, supporting the premise that hospitals respond to MIP by making risk mitigation efforts.

Initially, our clinical research focus was on the development of effective ways for treating chronically ill patients, mostly those suffering from neurological disorders. While we identified the medical benefits of this information technology, there remains a salient strategic question addressing its competitive impact. In this paper, we analyze the impact of introducing telemedicine on the market share of the specialty hospital deploying this technology and on the competing hospitals in the region. Our analytical results prove that, contrary to earlier expectations, the value of telemedicine relative to in-person visits is not always increasing with the distance of the patient from the hospital. This result explains why patients located far from the specialty hospital may not prefer telemedicine care. We prove that telemedicine, unlike numerous other e-commerce applications, does not lead to the ""winner takes all"" phenomenon. We found that the advent of telemedicine changes the competitive equilibrium between specialty hospitals and community hospitals.

This paper presents the story of scaling of an artifact (called District Health Information Software - DHIS) and associated principles and practices around a health information system that has taken place over 15. years, both within and between multiple developing countries. Through the lens of the story of the artifact over its trajectory of development and implementation in multiple contexts and time, we develop insights that challenge traditional thinking around scaling. Scaling is not about constant gains and expansion, as is often assumed, but involves a dichotomy of losses and gains, associated with each step or translation in its process of movement. We draw upon Latour's insights on circulating references to analyze this dichotomy of loss and gains, conceptualizing the process as circulating translations. We contribute to the technology transfer literature in arguing that the process of transfer is not about a ""parachuting"" from point A to B, or a ""design from nowhere"" but something which occurs in a series of small steps, where with each step new socio-technical configurations are created which not only shape subsequent steps, but also redefine the content of the artifact. In this way, we are in line with findings from the social studies of technology, but differ in that our artifact of study - software - is more ""virtually immaterial"" than machines which had been primarily earlier objects of study. This property of software, coupled with growth of web-based and mobile infrastructure, allows relative ease of circulation across contexts, where it gets redefined and embedded at the same time at the interconnected levels of the global and local. We conceptualize this process of global scaling as being ""same, same, but different"". We discuss both the characteristics of this process of global scaling, and the channels and mechanisms through which it takes place. Four overlapping conditions that shape this process include the software itself, the infrastructure, institutional practices, and ideas - these form the basis for a general framework to understand global scaling of health information systems. Empirically, the story of DHIS is told from its birth in the mid-nineties in South Africa developed on a Microsoft platform to its transformation to a web-based platform, built using Java based open-source frameworks, and now moving through multiple countries. We focus on these dynamics primarily within three countries namely India, Sierra Leone and Kenya. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

Building on the works of Anselm Strauss we conceptualize development processes as ""negotiated orders"" where members from different ""social worlds"" encounter and negotiate differences and tensions. We argue that processes of inquiry and action are interwoven, and this is what facilitates and stimulates learning. Based on a case study where different versions of open source software were customized, further developed and implemented in the Ethiopian public health care system, this paper explores the interplay between participation, politics and learning in IS implementation and use. We consider learning to be an integral part of the social practice, and it occurs mainly through encounters and negotiations between actors from different social worlds who might have competing interests and values. The paper also analyzed how the software in question functioned as a boundary object, not just in the traditional sense by facilitating cooperation among these actors. An even more significant role of the boundary object was in bringing the existing differences to the foreground and thus stimulating negotiations and learning. As such, this paper contributes to three discourses: organizational learning, boundary objects and health information systems in developing countries in particular and more specifically to IS implementation in settings with scarce resources, heterogeneous stakeholders, and diverse interests. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

Our analysis extends earlier research on the association between HIT and healthcare quality among healthcare providers that have previously focused on outcomes associated with cost reduction. We study the impact of HIT applications, not only on hospital operating expenses, but also on the process quality associated with evidence-based measures for treatment of four major health conditions. Our results indicate a positive association between usage of clinical information systems and patient scheduling applications and conformance with best practices for treatment of heart attacks, heart failures, and pneumonia. Our results also suggest that usage of financial management systems is associated with lower hospital operating expenses.

In particular, hospitals that attempt to fully implement an EHR in one year, the 'Big Bang' strategy, have relatively low TFP levels.

Many countries, including the United States, have developed preparedness plans for an influenza pandemic. Preparedness plans are falling under renewed scrutiny as decision-makers apply new findings and seek key leverage points for more effective preparedness and response. School closure has been recommended by the World Health Organization as one of the best ways to protect children and other susceptible individuals at the early stages of the pandemic. However, school closure is a difficult mitigation policy to implement from both strategic and operational points of view. Challenges include impacts on alternative education delivery services, such as student meals and after-school oversight, as well as direct and indirect economic outfalls. To help public health decision makers address these issues, we developed an epidemiological simulation tool for pandemic influenza which enables users to make decisions during a simulated pandemic. We then designed a school closure tabletop exercise using our simulation model as a decision-support tool for evaluating the effectiveness of school closure as a community mitigation strategy for pandemic influenza. We conducted two exercises in February 2009 for the Arizona Department of Health and Human Services including high-ranking health and education administrators from across the state. The purpose of these exercises was to test the state's pandemic preparedness plans with respect to school closure timing and impact. The exercises required participants to make (hypothetical) strategic and operational decisions to mitigate the impacts of pandemic influenza at the state and local levels. Our simulation and decision analysis tool was used to assess the impact of key decisions in the exercises. This paper presents the technical details involved in the design and evaluation of this pandemic decision-support tool. Based on the decisions made in the exercises, we present a bi-criteria decision analysis framework to evaluate analytical results obtained from the simulation model.

However, although the operating theater environment is clearly stochastic, the impact of this randomness has often been ignored. In practice, simple rules based largely on past experience (such as keeping a safety margin), are most frequently used when making plans for the operating theater. In this paper, we propose an approach to help rationalize, at a strategic decision-making level, the way in which stochasticity can be taken into account in operating theater management, to help in the sizing and in the allocation of capacity. The three main sources of randomness are considered: durations of operations, unexpected emergencies and blocking because of a full recovery unit. Based on the Markov theory, our tool enables several performance measures to be estimated. An operating theater manager can use our approach to make informed decisions and assess, for example, the disruption of the planning by emergencies, the waiting times for emergency patients, the impact of the recovery unit, or the distribution of the working time. In particular, our approach helps determine the number of operations that should be planned in order to keep expected overtime limited.

The multifaceted nature of medication adherence, due to a large number of underlying factors, presents several critical challenges including how to evaluate the current level of adherence, how to improve and how to maintain the required level of medication adherence, especially for long-term chronic conditions. Several interventions to improve adherence have been proposed in the healthcare literature, however these are complex, costly and difficult to implement. It is also not clear which ones would be effective at what levels of adherence in what conditions and types of patients. Therefore, there is a need to model, evaluate and compare the interventions individually as well as in combinations for their impact on medication adherence. To address this, the design and evaluation of smart medication management system (SMMS) for improving medication adherence are presented in this paper. We also present an analytical model for evaluating the medication adherence using multiple interventions that are supported from SMMS, namely context-aware reminders, improved scheduling of medications, and support from healthcare professionals. The performance results show that very high medication adherence is achievable by SMMS for single and multiple medications even for patients with mild cognitive deficiency. Several powerful ""composite"" interventions are also proposed and evaluated for medication adherence. It is also shown that the total healthcare savings are significant even for slightly improved medication adherence. With higher hospitalization cost, the savings due to improved medication adherence become even more significant. The proposed work forms the basis to design personalized interventions to patients for improving medication adherence in different surroundings. © 2012 Elsevier B.V."

Business processes are influenced by both organizational and operational concerns. We evaluate the comparative importance of operational and organizational influences for complementary IT systems. In the context of acute-care hospitals the analysis shows that an organizational approach to automating a process is related to different financial outcomes than an operational approach. Six complementary systems supporting a three-stage medication management process are studied: prescribing, dispensing, and administration. The analysis uses firm-level, panel data extracted from the HIMSS Analytics database spanning ten years of IT adoption for 140 hospitals. We have augmented the HIMSS dataset with matching demographic and financial details from the American Hospital Association and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Using event sequence analysis we explore whether organizations are more likely to adopt organization boundary spanning systems and if the sequence of adoption follows the temporal ordering of the business process steps. The research also investigates if there is a relationship between the paths to IT adoption and financial performance. Comparison of the two measures suggests that the organizational model of adoption is observed more often in the data. Following the organizational model of adoption is associated with approximately $155 dollar increase in net income per patient day; whereas the operational model of adoption is associated with approximately $225 dollars decrease in net income per patient day. However, this effect diminishes with the adoption of each additional system thus demonstrating that the adoption path effects may only be relevant in the short-term. © 2012 Elsevier B.V."

Patient monitoring applications largely rely on infrastructure based wireless networks for signal transmission. However, infrastructure based wireless networks till date, suffer from unpredictable network coverage and have thus been attributed to the unpredictable communication reliability of patient monitoring applications. This research investigates an approach based on leveraging mobile ad hoc network to address the challenge of enhancing communication reliability in the context of patient monitoring. Mobile ad hoc network, formed among patient monitoring devices, has the potential of enhancing network coverage and enabling signal transmission from an area which has low or non-existent coverage from infrastructure based networks. In order to utilize mobile ad hoc network in the context of patient monitoring we propose (1) power management protocols that address the challenge of managing the low battery power of patient monitoring devices while maximizing communication reliability and (2) a framework that models the complex decision logic involved in leveraging mobile ad hoc network for diverse patient monitoring scenarios. Analytical evaluation of the proposed approach supports the premise that mobile ad hoc network formed among patient monitoring devices can enhance the reliability of signal transmission thereby improving the quality of patient monitoring applications.

In this context, the current study has two objectives: First, to introduce a random effects continuation-ratio logit model, suitable for detecting stage wise transitions, to patient pathways modelling. Second, we aim at advancing our knowledge with regard to the application of modelling techniques to patient pathways. We study individual clinical pathways of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, a source of concern for major stakeholders. Data on COPD patients were extracted from the national English Hospital Episodes Statistics dataset. Individual patient pathways from initial admission through to more than four readmissions are captured. We notice that as patients are frequently readmitted, males are more likely to be in the higher risk group than females. Furthermore, the number of previous readmissions has a direct impact on the propensity of experiencing a further readmission. This model is very useful in detecting the most critical threshold at which multiple readmissions are more probable. Clinicians should note that a first readmission signifies a problem in the process of care and if care is not taken this may be the beginning of many subsequent readmissions. Our method could easily be implemented as a decision support tool to determine disease specific probabilities of multiple readmissions. Therefore, this could be a valuable tool for clinicians, health care managers, and policy makers for informed decision making in the management of diseases, which ultimately contributes to improved measures for hospital performance management.

Building on the current research in this area, our study proposes a model of initial trust formation in Web-based health information, rooted in the elaboration likelihood model (ELM) and Toulmin's model of argumentation. The proposed model theorizes trust as a function of perceived information quality and perceived risk, which are in turn determined by the structural quality of the message (argument quality) and the expertise of the message source (source expertise). Testing of the research model was accomplished via a field experiment involving 300 online users who had searched for health information on the Web. Overall, the results largely support the proposed model, explaining substantial variance in trust and highlighting the important but distinct roles that argument quality, source expertise, and user perceptions of information quality and risk play in determining an individual's decision to trust health information online. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The quality of ED services, measured by waiting time and length of stay, is significantly affected by patient arrivals. Increased patient arrivals could undermine service timeliness, thus putting patients in severe conditions at risk. These factors lead to the following research questions that have rarely been studied before: What are the variables directly associated with patient arrivals in the ED? What is the nature of association between these variables and patient arrivals? Which variable is the most influential and why? To address the above questions, we proposed a three-stage method in this paper. First, a data-driven method is used to identify contributing variables directly correlated with the daily arrivals of Categories 3 and 4 patients (i.e., non-critical patients). Second, the association between contributing variables and daily patient arrival is modeled by using artificial neural network (ANN), and the modeling ability is compared with that of nonlinear least square regression (NLLSR) and multiple linear regression (MLR) in terms of mean average percentage error (MAPE). Third, four types of relative importance (RI) of input variables based on ANN are compared, and their statistical reliability is tested by the MLR-based RI. We applied this three-stage method to one year of data of patient arrivals at a local ED. The contribution of this paper is twofold. Theoretically, this paper emphasizes the importance of using data-driven selection of variables for complex system modeling, and then provides a comprehensive comparison of RI using different computational methods. Practically, this work is a novel attempt of applying ANN to model patient arrivals, and the result can be used to aid in strategic decision-making on ED resource planning in response to predictable arrival variations. © 2013 Elsevier B.V."

Many networks govern through an infomediary (i.e., electronic broker) that brings together disparate member organizations. These networks can resemble an enterprise where standards and incentives for use are imposed on its partners. This study seeks to extend an enterprise IT governance (ITG) concept to the U.S. e-prescribing network as it transitions from a paper-based network to a computer-mediated one. The operating model, proposed by Ross et al (2006), emphasizes choices in standardization and integration to align strategy with operational processes to improve enterprise performance. Missing in their work is evidence that macro-level choices embedded in the operating model directly impact network workflow. A comparative synthesis traces the changes made to the U.S. e-prescribing operating model to their impact upon the roles and relationships among network members. Some workflow mis-alignments were traceable to the operating philosophy imposed by healthcare policy-makers. The study suggests IT alignment in networks may be better achieved through governing operating models rather than the traditional ITG focus on organizational forms. © 2013 Operational Research Society Ltd.

We study this question empirically in a health care setting. We show that active social media management drives more user-generated content. However, we find that this is due to an incremental increase in user postings from an organization's employees rather than from its clients. This result holds when we explore exogenous variation in social media policies, employees, and clients that are explained by medical marketing laws, medical malpractice laws, and distortions in Medicare incentives. Further examination suggests that content being generated mainly by employees can be avoided if a firm's postings are entirely client focused. However, most firm postings seem not to be specifically targeted to clients' interests, instead highlighting more general observations or achievements of the firm itself. We show that untargeted postings like these provoke activity by employees rather than clients. This may not be a bad thing because employee-generated content may help with employee motivation, recruitment, or retention, but it does suggest that social media should not be funded or managed exclusively as a marketing function of the firm. © 2013 INFORMS."

In fact, prior empirical studies have revealed that the (observed) successful read rate in real world RFID applications is just in between 60 and 70%. In this paper, motivated by this fact and the observed industrial practice of apparel control in health care organizations, we first conduct an analytical study to reveal when RFID systems will outperform the bar-coding system (and vice versa) in terms of reduction of the amount of required safety stock. We then extend our analysis to a supply chain context which includes the upstream apparel-product supplier and the downstream health care organization. We analytically prove several important insights which include: (i) The ratios between the RFID and bar-coding systems' stock-taking costs and error variations will determine whether one system outperforms the other. (ii) No matter whether the health care organization changes its scanning system from bar-coding to RFID or from RFID to bar-coding, it will only benefit the health care organization but the supplier will suffer. (iii) A carefully designed surplus sharing contract can create a win-win situation under which both the supplier and the health care organization will have improvement (in cost or profit) with the change of the scanning system.

Addressing this research gap is important considering that a substantial number of adverse hospital events stem from communication failures. Furthermore, effective communication is a major driver of patient satisfaction in hospitals. Using a structure-process-outcome (SPO) framework and guided by the strategic role of IT literature, we develop a model that includes ""structure,"" operationalized as organizational characteristics and two different categories of IT; ""process,"" two different communication-based processes; and ""outcomes,"" quantified as case-mix adjusted mortality, patient loyalty, and patient ratings. Specifically, we hypothesize that a subset of clinical IT (cardiology IT) will affect technical protocols of patient care, which in turn affects mortality, while administrative IT will affect interpersonal patient care, which relates to patient loyalty and ratings. Thus, IT can serve as a double-edged sword affecting both technical and interpersonal processes of care, but possibly independently and differentially. We test our hypotheses on 2,179 hospitals using data collected and matched from three different sources. Our findings suggest that different types of IT differentially affect hospital processes and these same processes influence performance metrics such as mortality and patient satisfaction. For example, cardiology IT has a greater effect on objective patient health status through improvements in the technical protocols of care. Surprisingly, administrative IT was shown to adversely affect interpersonal care processes. It could be true that the IT is intrusive and interferes in the doctor-patient relationship; however, a post hoc analysis suggests the possibility of curvilinear impacts. Thus, managers should recognize that over- and underinvestment in IT can potentially have negative effects on performance and these results vary by IT type. Both technical and interpersonal processes yielded significant relationships to their respective outcomes and some cross-outcome effects were found, further suggesting that the mediating role of processes is an important link between IT and value. © 2012 M.E.

The early adoption of patient portals by ambulatory-care clinics (outpatient health providers) presents a unique opportunity to more fully understand the characteristics of supply-side adopters in a context where firms (ambulatory-care clinics) are extending digital services to consumers (patients). Using diffusion of innovations literature and contingency theory as the theoretical base, we expand upon the firm characteristics traditionally considered to be predictors of adoption (e.g., firm size, slack resources, competition, capabilities, and management support) and examine how demand contingencies, service contingencies, and learning externality contingencies affect patient portal adoption by ambulatory-care clinics in the United States. We find that early adopters often have a structure in place that provides support for innovations (e.g., part of integrated delivery systems), as would be predicted by diffusion of innovation theory. We also find, though, that service contingencies associated with continuity of care, learning externality contingencies associated with local influences, and select demand contingencies associated with the local market significantly influence patient portal adoption decisions. Our findings suggest that the adoption and diffusion of patient portals may be affected by more than traditionally considered ""dominant"" firm characteristics and provide insights into how such customer-facing systems may be affected by contingent factors. © 2012 M.E.

The setting is the National Health Service in the United Kingdom, where in 2002 a major government policy was launched to introduce Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to over 50 million citizens. Using episodic interviewing techniques and content analysis of government health IT policy documents, this study provides a longitudinal analysis of the introduction of government policy to modernize health care using information technology. Institutional isomorphic conditions become conflicted with attempts to impose field and organizational change. As clinicians attempt to retain their professional dominance in a climate of almost continuous restructuring of health services, political initiatives to implement EHRs are met with resistance from key stakeholders, resulting in policy changes and further delayed implementation times. © 2012 JIT Palgrave Macmillan.

Yet, there is limited empirical data about the antecedents and consequences of IT governance.

This research compares the accuracy of the linear autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model and the nonlinear neural network model in producing forecasts of medical cost inflation rates. The analysis focuses on twelve monthly measures of medical costs including the overall medical care price index and eleven (disaggregated) subsectors of medical costs. In addition to standard symmetric measures of forecast accuracy, we utilize two asymmetric error measures designed to capture and penalize preferences for under- and overprediction in model selection. The findings indicate that the neural network model outperforms the univariate ARMA in both 1-step and 12-step ahead forecasts.

According to the knowledge-based view, KM-enabled performance should be rooted in the identification of knowledge resources, including knowledge assets and capabilities. Further, the concept of dynamic capabilities defines an interaction feature between knowledge assets and capabilities. Next, KM-enabled performance is generally defined to include both financial and patient performance.

We conduct a field study at the call center of a prominent U.S. health insurance firm to examine this cost-saving rationale of the Web-based selfservice channel. On the one hand, the Web channel may substitute for the telephony channel in some cases. On the other hand, the Web also exposes customers to a vast amount of information about their health policy, claims, and coverage; this information can create uncertainty leading to customers seeking more information and hence making more telephone calls. We designed a quasi-natural experiment in our field setting and used difference-in-difference specifications to show that the Web-based self-service usage leads to a 14% increase in telephone calls. We conduct several robustness checks to show that our specifications are robust to any potential selection of customers in the Web-based self-service usage. We further find that the impact of Web portal usage is moderated by the Web portal characteristics.

We examine the assimilation of EHRS in physician practices through a novel and understudied theoretical lens of physicians' identities. Physician practices and the physicians that lead them occupy a central position in the healthcare value chain and possess a number of unique characteristics that differentiate them from other institutional contexts, including a strong sense of affiliation with other physicians, potent professional identities, and a desire for autonomy. We investigate two salient physician identities, those of careprovider and physician community, grounded in the roles physicians play and the groups with which they affiliate. We argue that these identities and their evolution, triggered by EHRS, manifest as both identity reinforcement and deterioration, and are important drivers of EHRS assimilation. We use survey data from 206 physician practices, spread across the United States, to test our theoretical model. Results suggest that physician community identity reinforcement and physician community identity deterioration directly influence the assimilation of EHRS. We further find that the effects of careprovider identity reinforcement and careprovider identity deterioration on EHRS assimilation are moderated by governmental influence.

We gathered actual sale transactions for NPT hospitals in the United States to derive the q ratio, a measure of market value.

For example, studies have found nearly half of all US patients receive inadequate care each year, over 2 million are harmed by hospital-acquired infections, and over 1 million suffer disabling complications during surgery - even though half of these are thought to be avoidable. These challenges have catalyzed the beginning of a transformation in care delivery, from a health-care system that focuses on disease to one that must look after patients - including individuals and communities. To provide proper treatment to those who are chronically ill, the health-care system has to support improved individuals health-related practices prior to the manifestation of disease; ensure that a range of practitioners can deliver quality clinical care during the onset of an illness; and facilitate patient-provider-family partnerships during post-disease wellness care. As we describe in this review, key advances in networking and information technologies - spanning patient monitoring, data visualization and decision making, robotics and computer vision for diagnosis and surgery, social networking for fostering community-based support systems, and so on - stand to drive forward these changes. Together with social scientists, systems engineers, medical practitioners, and computer scientists, information systems scholars can help alter the nature of care delivery well into the twenty-first century, ultimately contributing to a system that is much more safe, effective, reliable, and timely than it is today. © 2011 JIT Palgrave Macmillan All rights reserved."

Our empirical material describes two Danish initiatives, where a national project failed to deliver interoperable Electronic Patient Record (EPR) systems while a small, local solution grew and now offers a nation-wide solution for sharing patient record information. We apply II theory, specifically the five design principles proposed by Hanseth and Lyytinen, to contrast the organization and implementation strategies of the two projects. Our findings highlight how implementation strategies differ with respect to how stakeholders are mobilized. We argue that the realization of nation-wide IIs for healthcare not only requires a gradual transition of the installed base, which current II theory advocates.

Though organizations attempt to obscure the identities of their constituents when sharing information for worthwhile purposes, such as basic research, the uncoordinated nature of such environment can lead to privacy vulnerabilities. For instance, disparate healthcare providers can collect information on the same patient. Federal policy requires that such providers share ""de-identified"" sensitive data, such as biomedical (e.g., clinical and genomic) records. But at the same time, such providers can share identified information, devoid of sensitive biomedical data, for administrative functions. On a provider-by-provider basis, the biomedical and identified records appear unrelated, however, links can be established when multiple providers' databases are studied jointly. The problem, known as trail disclosure, is a generalized phenomenon and occurs because an individual's location access pattern can be matched across the shared databases. Due to technical and legal constraints, it is often difficult to coordinate between providers and thus it is critical to assess the disclosure risk in distributed environments, so that we can develop techniques to mitigate such risks. Research on privacy protection has so far focused on developing technologies to suppress or encrypt identifiers associated with sensitive information. There is a growing body of work on the formal assessment of the disclosure risk of database entries in publicly shared databases, but less attention has been paid to the distributed setting. In this research, we review the trail disclosure problem in several domains with known vulnerabilities and show that disclosure risk is influenced by the distribution of how people visit service providers. Based on empirical evidence, we propose an entropy metric for assessing such risk in shared databases prior to their release. This metric assesses risk by leveraging the statistical characteristics of a visit distribution, as opposed to person-level data. It is computationally efficient and superior to existing risk assessment methods, which rely on ad hoc assessment that are often computationally expensive and unreliable. We evaluate our approach on a range of location access patterns in simulated environments. Our results demonstrate that the approach is effective at estimating trail disclosure risks and the amount of self-information contained in a distributed system is one of the main driving factors. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This study examines learning curves in an IT-PRS setting to determine whether agents achieve performance improvements from cumulative experience at different rates and how information technologies transform the learning dynamics in this setting. We present a hierarchical Bayes model that accounts for different agent skills (domain and system) and estimate learning rates for three types of referral requests: emergency (EM), nonemergency (NE), and nonemergency out of network (NO). Furthermore, the model accounts for learning spillovers among the three referral request types and the impact of system upgrade on learning rates. We estimate this model using data from more than 80,000 referral requests to a large IT-PRS. We find that: (1) The IT-PRS exhibits a learning rate of 4.5% for EM referrals, 7.2% for NE referrals, and 12.3% for NO referrals. This is slower than the learning rate of manufacturing (on average 20%) and more comparable to other service settings (on average, 8%). (2) Domain and system experts are found to exhibit significantly different learning behaviors. (3) Significant and varying learning spillovers among the three referral request types are also observed. (4) The performance of domain experts is affected more adversely in comparison to system experts immediately after system upgrade. (5) Finally, the learning rate change subsequent to system upgrade is also higher for system experts in comparison to domain experts. Overall, system upgrades are found to have a long-term positive impact on the performance of all agents.

In this context, we find that an independent PHR platform can create incentives for the providers to share their patients' records electronically with other providers by selectively subsidizing them. In a pluralistic health-care system like that in the United States, where health-care providers have varying incentives to implement electronic health records, an online PHR platform can provide a proxy for a ""national health information network,""' wherein consumers can freely exchange their health records among competing providers. © 2011 INFORMS."

Our findings suggest that the key to successful implementation is to manage the co-evolution process between routines and HIT and to actively orchestrate a virtuous cycle through agentic action.

A longitudinal study of an e-healthcare system implementation, with data gathered from doctors, paraprofessionals, administrative personnel, patients, and usage logs lent support to the hypotheses that: (1) ingroup and outgroup ties to doctors negatively affect use in all user groups; (2) ingroup and outgroup ties to paraprofessionals and administrative personnel positively affect use in both those groups, but have no effect on doctors' use; and (3) use contributes positively to patient satisfaction mediated by healthcare quality variables-i.e., technical quality, communication, interpersonal interactions, and time spent.

There is little else that is as consequential to an individual as his or her health. In this context, the privacy of one's personal health information has escalated as a matter of significant concern for the public. We pose the question: under what circumstances will individuals be willing to disclose identified personal health information and permit it to be digitized? Using privacy boundary theory and recent developments in the literature related to risk-as-feelings as the core conceptual foundation, we propose and test a model explicating the role played by type of information requested (general health, mental health, genetic), the purpose for which it is to be used (patient care, research, marketing), and the requesting stakeholder (doctors/hospitals, the government, pharmaceutical companies) in an individual's willingness to disclose personal health information. Furthermore, we explore the impact of emotion linked to one's health condition on willingness to disclose. Results from a nationally representative sample of over 1,000 adults underscore the complexity of the health information disclosure decision and show that emotion plays a significant role, highlighting the need for re-examining the timing of consent. Theoretically, the study extends the dominant cognitive-consequentialist approach to privacy by incorporating the role of emotion. It further refines the privacy calculus to incorporate the moderating influence of contextual factors salient in the healthcare setting.

Various information systems (IS) projects have been undertaken to enhance public health capacity for detect- ing EID in a timely manner and disseminating important public health information to concerned parties. While those initiatives seemed to offer promising solutions, public health researchers and practitioners raised concerns about their overall effectiveness. In this paper, we argue that the concerns about current public health IS projects are partially rooted in the lack of a comprehensive framework that captures the complexity of EID management to inform and evaluate the development of public health IS. We leverage loose coupling to analyze news cov- erage and contact tracing data from 479 patients associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Taiwan. From this analysis, we develop a framework for outbreak management. Our proposed framework identifies two types of causal circles-coupling and decoupling circles-between the central public health administration and the local capacity for detecting unusual patient cases. These two circles are triggered by important information-centric activities in public health practices and can have significant influence on the effectiveness of EID management. We derive seven design guidelines from the framework and our analysis of the SARS outbreak in Taiwan to inform the development of public health IS. We leverage the guidelines to evaluate current public health initiatives. By doing so, we identify limitations of existing public health IS, highlight the direction future development should consider, and discuss implications for research and public health policy. © 2011 INFORMS."

In this paper, we argue that IS proficiency at the group level may be more than the simple sum or average of the IS proficiency of individual group members. Rather, effective group-level IS proficiency may also be a function of how a group's IS proficiency is distributed across its members. Relying on concepts associated with social network analysis (SNA), we introduce the concept of centrality-IS proficiency alignment. We argue that groups will perform better if their more proficient members are highly central in the group's communication and workflows network. Data from 468 employees in 32 workgroups show that centrality-IS proficiency alignment is significantly and positively related to performance across multiple systems examined individually and with the portfolio of systems examined as a whole. This approach effectively integrates the structural and resource perspectives of SNA, providing a roadmap so that others may follow a similar approach to address broader questions of group-level user-system interactions in the IS literature and more general questions of central resource alignment in the broader organizational literature."

Health informatics should address these issues from a sound conceptual base, such as might be provided by critical theory, which seeks to identify hidden assumptions and ideologies. This discipline can provide a better understanding of the inner workings of socio-technical systems, with a view to improving them through the promotion of emancipation (allowing people to fulfill their potential). Critical theory can also shed light on the problems with health information systems and offer insight into remedies, for example, by relating Habermas' theories about communication to feedback, a concept central to quality assurance (QA). Such analysis finds that QA's principal practices can be interpreted as emancipatory but requires organizations to substantially change their behavior. An alternate approach is to install health information systems designed to support QA. Applying critical theory to these systems shows that they could become an active part of service delivery rather than static repositories of data, because they may encourage standardized conversations between all stakeholders about the important features of health care. Success will depend on access for all participants to data entry and analysis tools, integration with work practice, and use by staff and management in QA. These ideas offer new directions for research into and the development of health information systems. The next step will be to implement them and observe their technical and emancipatory properties."

An exploratory study of all physicians in all clinics operated by a large health maintenance organization (HMO) was conducted using a transparent computerized agent that collected 1.21 million prescriptions prescribed by 647 physicians. Compliance with HMO recommendations for substitute drugs reached a 70 percent rate. Substitute type, whether generic or therapeutic, was found to be the most significant factor affecting compliance, with physician workload and age second and third in effect magnitude, respectively. Compliance was found to be non-automatic and selective, following a thoughtful cognitive process. The HMO realized at least a 4 percent reduction in costs for prescribed drugs as a result of compliance with substitute recommendations. The results can be interpreted via the lens of Organizational Justice Theory, assuming that the broad compliance with generic substitutes was driven by perception of just procedures, whereas there was no such perception in the case of therapeutic substitutes. While more research is warranted for investigating the motivations driving physicians' compliance, we strongly feel that the results can be generalized to other HMOs and healthcare settings."

Using Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliance within the healthcare industry as a practical proxy for general organizational privacy policy compliance, the results of this survey of 234 healthcare professionals indicate that certain social conditions within the organizational setting (referred to as external cues and comprising situational support, verbal persuasion, and vicarious experience) contribute to an informal learning process.

However, recent changes in Medicare payments and regulations in the US have challenged home health care providers' business models. Against this backdrop, we draw on the dynamic capability perspective to examine how one home health care provider responded to this challenge over the period 2000-2009 by combining adaptive organization principles and information technology (IT) to transform its post-acute care delivery. The transformation leveraged the organization's existing dynamic capabilities; improved nursing practices; engaged physicians, nurses, managers, and patients; and implemented remote patient monitoring and other IT-enabled innovations. Integrating information systems and health services literatures, we identify the processes targeted by the transformation, analyze how the provider built adaptive care delivery capability enabled by IT, and demonstrate how the transformation led to improved clinical and financial outcomes. In addition, we offer new insights into the micro-foundations of dynamic capabilities by distinguishing between capabilities at the transactional and transformational levels, and explaining how different types of IT-enabled capabilities shaped, and were shaped by, the home health care provider's responses to environmental changes."

Burn patients generally experience long hospital stays, and the accurate prediction of the length of those stays has strong implications for healthcare resource management and service delivery. In addition to prediction accuracy, the timing of length of hospital stay (LOS) predictions is also relevant, because LOS predictions during earlier clinical stages (e.g., admission) can provide an important component for service and resource planning as well as patient and family counseling, whereas LOS predictions at later clinical stages (e.g., post-treatment) can support resource utilization reviews and cost controls. This study evaluates the effectiveness of LOS predictions for burn patients during three different clinical stages: admission, acute, and post-treatment. In addition, we compare the prediction effectiveness of two artificial intelligence (AI)-based prediction techniques (i.e., model-tree-based regression and support vector machine regression), using linear regression analysis as our performance benchmark. On the basis of 1080 burn cases collected in Taiwan, the empirical evaluation suggests that the accuracy of LOS predictions at the acute stage does not improve compared with those during the admission stage, but LOS predictions at the post-treatment stage are significantly more accurate. Moreover, the AI-based prediction techniques, especially support vector machine regression, appear more effective than the regression technique for LOS predictions for burn patients across stages. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this example, fragmented multi-actor agency induced an inconsistent implementation mode, leading to unsuccessful telecare appropriation. This paper concludes with a preliminary proposal for more consistent telecare implementation modes.

First, we use this concomitant modality to explain why previous studies into the structure of the Information Systems discipline have reported contradictory results, with some finding a focused field while others conclude that the field is diverse. In support of our argument, we then present the results of a longitudinal, author co-citation analysis, looking across the full range of journals in which IS research is published. Our results suggest that the IS field has sustained a focus on research within three subfields over a 20- year period from 1986 to 2005: (1) a thematic miscellany of research on development, implementation, and use of systems in various application domains; (2) IS strategy and business outcomes; and (3) group work and decision support. At the same time, the field has demonstrated considerable diversity within and around these core subfields, with researchers responding flexibly to the rapidly changing field by investigating these areas with new paradigms and in new contexts, and by exploring new topics including inter-business and Internet applications, computer-supported collaborative work, virtual teams, and knowledge management. Finally, we demonstrate that, over the 20-year period from 1986 to 2005, the discipline has shifted from fragmented adhocracy to a polycentric state, which is particularly appropriate to an applied discipline such as IS that must address the dual demands of focus and diversity in a rapidly changing technological context."

However, it does not explicitly account for how organisational actors make sense of and enact technologies in their local context. We address this limitation by exploring the potential of using institutional theory with sensemaking theory to study IS implementation in organisations. We argue that each theoretical perspective has its own explanatory power and that a combination of the two facilitates a much richer interpretation of IS implementation by linking macro- and micro-levels of analysis. To illustrate this, we report from an empirical study of the implementation of an Electronic Patient Record (EPR) system in a clinical setting. Using key constructs from the two theories, our findings address the phenomenon of implementing EPRs at three levels: the organisational field, the organisational/group, and the individual/socio-cognitive level. The study shows how a rationalised myth of an efficient EPR system has travelled from the organisational field to the hospital ward and on to individual doctors. The findings also provide evidence of a strong human agency by showing how doctors enact their work practices and shape the use of the EPR system. The study contributes to IS research by showing the need to address macro-level structures, as well as individual interpretations and practical use situations, in order to identify how and why information systems are adopted by users. © 2009 JIT Palgrave Macmillan All rights reserved."

In this study, we have developed a framework for automatic online news monitoring and classification for syndromic surveillance. The framework is unique and none of the techniques adopted in this study have been previously used in the context of syndromic surveillance on infectious diseases. In recent classification experiments, we compared the performance of different feature subsets on different machine learning algorithms. The results showed that the combined feature subsets including Bag of Words, Noun Phrases, and Named Entities features outperformed the Bag of Words feature subsets. Furthermore, feature selection improved the performance of feature subsets in online news classification. The highest classification performance was achieved when using SVM upon the selected combination feature subset. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

It extends the literature on information economics by quantifying the benefits in process dynamics as a source of ongoing firm-level performance improvements. The key dimensions of measurements include financial revenues, operating lead times, and subjective satisfaction levels by the clinical staff and by the referring physicians. Analyses of longitudinal data suggest that performance levels along a key metric-clinical process lead time-showed a significant improvement immediately after the deployment and integration of the systems. The evidence reveals that performance kept improving for the following 12 months at an impressive learning rate of 63 percent. Moreover, the reported satisfaction level after installation was higher among referring physicians who actively used the full spectrum of technological functionalities at their own clinics or at the hospital's site.

One type of IS is representative of information technology (IT) used in primary, clinical, value-chain activities, and the other is representative of the IT used in support (administrative) value-chain activities. The model innovation is that it accommodates up to a seven-year lag for each type of IS. The output variables for the production function are hospital output and medical labor productivity. Using data spanning from 1979 to 2006 from several hospitals, it was found that clinical IS improve hospital output in the short run (of two years). Administrative IS were found to be negatively associated with organizational performance in the short run, but positively associated with these performance measures over the long run (over four years). These results highlight the importance of timing IT investments and the sequencing chosen for the implementation of IS presenting various value-chain activities, and the resulting pattern of business value over time.

It is argued given the nature and complexity of HIS, there is the need to bring together our understanding of participation from two streams of development theory and IS design and development. While development theory provides interesting insights on how to enable participatory processes, they tend to not consider technology. Further, traditional participatory design in Information Systems research has its origins in Western workplaces, often quite divorced from the context of public health in developing countries. In trying to combine these two streams of learning, we propose and develop the concept of participatory networks. Drawing upon an ongoing empirical analysis of an action research effort to introduce, scale and sustain Health Information Systems in Kerala, this paper elaborates on the nature of participatory networks that come into play, and the various mechanisms and purposes of participation with the different network partners. In the discussion section, four areas of re-conceptualization of participation in the context of HIS in developing countries are identified: (1) creation of participatory networks; (2) increased context sensitivity; (3) focus on outputs of participation, not just inputs and techniques; and, (4) focus on structural aspects of participation, not just behavioral issues. © 2008."

We argue that during HIS design activities, it is essential for both practitioners and system designers to articulate and identify which aspects can be standardized without constraining important local flexibility and which aspects require local reconfiguration to function in a particular work context. To identify these differences, we suggest an analytical distinction between boundary factors and contextual contingencies, which can be used in a design and reconfiguration process. We argue that the process of designing shared electronic templates should be perceived as a common design process, where multiple stakeholders articulate, identify, and negotiate boundary factors and contextual contingencies. Boundary factors are then represented within the shared electronic system, whereas contextual contingencies form the basis for constructing localized versions of the shared application. All local versions include both boundary factors and the reconfigured contextual contingencies. © 2009 Operational Research Society Ltd. All rights reserved."

A significant mechanism of growth is when previously unconnected systems are integrated, facilitating the transition from networking to inter-networking. Conversely, failure to integrate systems contributes to the lack of evolution of the infrastructure. Integration seems crucial for evolving infrastructures; however, there is little consensus on what it entails, as can be seen when different connotations of ""integration"" are unpacked. In contrast to the dominant view of integration as a largely technical concern, our focus is on how political and institutional interests are embedded in efforts to achieve integration. More specifically, we explore strategies for institutional integration that take into account uneven distribution of political influence. The paper builds on empirical material from our ongoing (2001 - 2008) involvement with the problem of fragmented information systems in the health care sector in India. The case is seen from the perspective of one small actor offering free, open-source software that is already being used in several other developing countries. Choosing to focus on a small actor highlights the asymmetric power relations among the actors; our actor has no other option than to seek to align with bigger and more influential actors.

However, in spite of the anticipated value potential of this technology, there is widespread concern that consumer privacy issues may impede its diffusion. In this study, we pose the question: Can individuals be persuaded to change their attitudes and opt-in behavioral intentions towardEHRs, and allow their medical information to be digitized even in thepresence of significant privacy concerns? To investigate this question, we integrate an individual's concern for information privacy (CFIP) with the elaboration likelihood model (ELM) to examine attitude change and likelihood of opting-in to an EHR system. We theorize that issue involvement and argument framing interact to influence attitude change, and that concern for information privacy further moderates the effects of these variables. We also propose that likelihood of adoption is driven by concern for information privacy and attitude. We test our predictions using an experiment with 366 subjects where we manipulate the framing of the arguments supporting EHRs. We find that an individual's CFIP interacts with argument framing and issue involvement to affect attitudes toward the use of EHRs. In addition, results suggest that attitude towardEHR use and CFIP directly influence opt-in behavioral intentions. An important finding for both theory and practice is that even when people have high concerns for privacy, their attitudes can be positively altered with appropriate message framing.

Using a heuristic proposed in queuing theory, we provide the optimal investment in telemedicine technology together with the staffing policy, considering the various cost components, including staffing, technology investment, incorrect treatment, and waiting. The model also incorporates buy-in by the patients in the form of the arrival (show-up) rate dependent on the technology level established.

During the monitoring, vital signs of patients could fluctuate significantly and/or match certain undesirable patterns and therefore ""alerts"" or emergency messages must be delivered to healthcare professionals. In this paper, we address how patient monitoring, specifically emergency messages, can be supported over wireless ad hoc network formed among patients' devices. The framework describes a wireless patient monitoring system that includes patient monitoring devices, routing protocols and information presentation for vitals signs and parameters. This involves a series of decisions in obtaining and processing vital signs, routing over networks, and delivering to healthcare professionals, who must make suitable medical decisions on patients' healthcare needs. Additionally, several design enhancements to improve the quality and coverage of wireless patient monitoring are presented. The performance results for the proposed ad hoc network based architecture show that reliable message delivery and low monitoring delays can be achieved by using multicast or broadcast-based routing schemes.

This approach is illustrated by means of an in-depth case study. This case study indicates that focusing on power and interest relationships may help make the critical success factors in the implementation and improvement of inter-organizational systems more explicit. The framework explicitly stimulates users to repeat their analysis of the players and their power and interests in order to acquire new 'pictures' of the playing field.

We use the concept of trajectory to focus our observations and interviews on workflow across groups and critical events when coordination breaks down. A careful examination of the sources, coping mechanisms, and consequences of coordination breakdowns suggests three factors whose absence may impede effective responses to unexpected interruptions: (1) trajectory awareness of what is going on beyond a person's immediate workspace, (2) information systems integration, and (3) information pooling and learning at the organizational level.

There have been a number of studies underscoring the importance of trust in the online environment. However, most trust studies have concentrated on the initial trust, and there is little known about how trust beliefs evolve over time. The dynamics of trust are of particular importance in the use of infornediaries (online information providers), among which health infornediaries are the most important for Web consumers in dealing with their wellness and health issues. We investigate the evolution of trust using the case of health infornediaries. The examination of the temporal changes in trust was carried out through two approaches - comparative statics and dynamic analyses. The research method was laboratory experiment and the data were collected for two episodes of encounters. Two comparative statics models and one dynamic model were estimated in order to examine the parameter changes from one episode of encounter to the next as well as the dynamics of belief changes. The results of analysis show that the structure of trust changes over time and information quality becomes the single most important antecedent in infomediary trust building in the later stages of use. Furthermore, our study also indicates that satisfaction plays an important role in changing Web customers'trust beliefs.

This paradox suggests that the healthcare industry presents particular challenges for successful implementation of information systems. As a result, there is an increasing interest in research into how information systems implementation efforts are shaped in interaction with the healthcare context. This paper contributes to this emerging body of knowledge by applying Actor-Network Theory (ANT) to explore the implementation of a radiology network system in a Swedish hospital. The analysis of the process reveals how complex contextual dynamics had disruptive effects. First, we identified important dynamics related to implementation content; these were mainly expressed as tensions between the radiology network system and medical work practices. Second, we found important dynamics related to implementation context; these were mainly expressed as tensions between shifting networks of actors within the implementation project and the broader institutional setting. Seeking to understand contextual dynamics during healthcare information systems implementation, we use events to focus, structure, and present the ANT analysis. This event-based approach furthers our understanding of how researchers can apply ANT to study IT-based change in general. © 2008 Operational Research Society Ltd. All rights reserved."

Standardizing and scaling have, in existing research, been treated primarily as independent technical processes that are isolated from the institutional context in which they take place. This paper tries to redress this balance in this research in two ways. Firstly, it argues for these processes to be taken as inter-related which can both support and undermine each other. Secondly, this mutual interaction is argued to be mediated by the institutional context. Specifically, we draw upon concepts from institutional theory inspired by Douglas North, focusing on the degree of overlap between formal institutions (attempts to establish formal policy on activities such as the definition of indicators and uniform reporting formats) and informal constraints in practice reflected in inadequate capacity - both technological and human, and existing work practices. © 2008 Operational Research Society Ltd.

Eliminating such workarounds is desirable, but information system (IS) researchers tend to treat computer workarounds as black-boxes, whereas HIS researchers are primarily concerned with descriptive or prescriptive remedies. We propose to open the black-box of computer workarounds and study them as situated practices that consist of adjustments to existing computer-based procedures, which are enabled by the negotiated order of a hospital. This negotiative property of a hospital's organizational environment allows for interpretive flexibility, in which physicians stretch certain rules in practice, while inducing others to cooperate. We illustrate this conceptual framework with a non-participant observer case study of a medication dispensing system used in a teaching hospital to support a prior-approval policy for anti-microbial drugs. Within these enacted workaround practices, we found significant variety in roles, timing and interactions, which boil down to a pattern of four practices revolving around one function of an HIS. Our research extends the literature on computer workarounds in IS and HIS by proposing a theoretical understanding of workaround practices based on a contextual healthcare study. © 2008 Operational Research Society Ltd.

It has been widely observed that there is a general trend toward markets. It has also been observed that the transaction cost approach cannot explain empirical observations where the choice of governance has more to do with power and behavioral attributes of transacting actors than with minimizing transaction costs. Information systems researchers have overcome the shortcomings of the transaction cost approach to a limited extent by complementing it with political economy, resource-dependency and network theories. However, these complementary perspectives cannot easily analyze the interactions between power and efficiency and cannot handle the impact of the institutional environment on the choice of governance structure. This research exposes the shortcomings of these complementary perspectives in the light of a range of institutionalist studies drawn from economics, sociology and anthropology. The research points out that an institutional approach is essential for understanding and overcoming the complications that may arise as IT-enabled moves toward markets are launched in organizations that are situated in institutional environments that are at present not compatible with market-oriented exchange arrangements.

We analyze the major contradictions that characterize the adoption of the innovation. First, we analyze contradictions between individuals and groups within each adopting organization. Second, we analyze contradictions between the adopting organizations. This multi-level analysis leads to a deeper understanding of resilience as a dialectical process. The analysis of the case shows that, although the participating individuals, groups, and organizations demonstrated apparent resilience in adopting the telehealth innovation, the innovation remained in a fragile state, where it was unclear whether it would continue to diffuse, stabilize as-is, or slowly deteriorate. Hence, while resilience facilitated swift and successful adoption, it also created tensions that endangered further diffusion and the long-term sustainability of the telehealth innovation.

Effectiveness of health infomediaries depends on people's trust in them. In this paper, we conceptualize a comprehensive synthesis of trust antecedents that are relevant to health infomediaries based on trust research and the actor-network theory. The model is constructed to highlight the factors that play a significant role in trust formation in health infomediaries. The empirical test of the model indicates that web users' beliefs about the ability and benevolence of the health infomediary critically affect their behavior intentions. Moreover, testing has identified the dimensions of information and system quality as well as the trust signs that enhance each trust belief. Environmental factors also play a significant role in enhancing beliefs about the ability and integrity of the health infomediary. Our empirical results further show that an individual user's propensity to trust has a significant relationship with risk-related beliefs. Such trust and risk beliefs positively influence web users' behaviors. Our study shows the importance of context-specific modeling of trust in health infomediaries. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

A considerable number of studies have been conducted regarding organizational information technology (IT) adoption, but the nature of the organizational IT adoption process is still not well understood. Especially, although there are a number of variables and categories that have been found empirically to be related to adoption behavior, there is little in the way of evidence to suggest the origin or motivation behind the adoption. Thus, this study investigates the underlying motivations and driving forces behind the adoption of RFID using the theory of technology-push and need-pull. In this study, an organizational RFID adoption model is proposed and empirically tested by a survey using a sample of 126 senior executives in U.S. hospitals. The model posits that three categories of factors, technology push, need pull, and presence of champions, determine the likelihood of adopting RFID within organizations. This study also found that the relationships between those three categories and the likelihood of adopting RFID are strengthened or weakened by organizational readiness. © 2007 Operational Research Society Ltd.

It is particularly challenging in institutionalized settings such as hospitals. We report an interpre-tive field study of computerized physician order entry (CPOE) at an acute-care hospital, in which we investigated how institutionally triggered and technology-triggered change interacted in complementary processes to engender alignment. Social structure changes included increased interdependency among clinical departments, multidisciplinary cooperation across clinical disciplines, and standardization in clinical decision-making. Organization members also enacted institutionalized interaction patterns with physicians by deferring to their preferences for CPOE use. The cumulative influence of change triggers nonetheless facilitated the hospital's realization of clinical goals. We drew on Barley's (1990) role- and network-based model for technology and structure alignment. Nonetheless, we extended this microlevel analytic approach to account for the influence of change in the macro-institutional environment. Our analysis clarified the extent of structure change attributable to the CPOE technology and highlighted institutional forces that promoted yet inhibited change. The case also highlighted the importance of role networks on the trajectory and outcomes of organizational change processes."

These applications allow patients to both communicate with their providers and access personal medical information, such as laboratory results. Research within medical informatics explores, and debates, the utility of such functions from the patient and physician perspectives. However, work does not examine factors influencing patient use, assuming that once built and deployed patients will come. Hence, the current research empirically investigates patient behavioral intentions (BI) with respect to (a) use of electronic communications functions and (b) accessing of individual medical information through an Internet-based patient-physician portal. Surveying 294 patients, this work incorporates individual factors, namely computer self-efficacy and personal innovativeness in the domain of information technology, with technology-based factors identified in the Technology Acceptance Model. The analysis finds that usefulness and innovativeness have a positive direct effect on BI with respect to both functions, namely communications and information access. Additionally, patients with greater healthcare needs foresee increased use of portals to access their personal medical information. Finally, patients in primary care, as opposed to specialist, provider settings intend to engage in electronic communications. © 2007 Operational Research Society Ltd. All rights reserved."

This model elaborates the interdependent and asymmetric effects of inhibiting usage perceptions, such as resistance, on HIT usage intentions relative to enabling perceptions, such as perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. It also proposes perceived threat as a predictor of resistance, perceived compatibility as predicting perceived usefulness, and related knowledge as predicting perceived ease of use. The resulting model is empirically supported using a field survey of a computerized physician order entry system among 129 practicing physicians at a large acute-care hospital. Our study illustrates the importance of incorporating user resistance in technology usage studies in general and HIT usage studies in particular, grounds resistance research within extant theories of technology usage, and provides a preliminary model of resistance that can serve as the starting point for future research in this relatively unexplored yet potentially fertile area of research. © 2007 Operational Research Society Ltd.

Yet, our ability to understand and manage how IT-based innovations unfold in the context of healthcare is still limited. In this paper, we apply Van de Ven's industry infrastructure framework to investigate a telehealth innovation that provides remote medical assistance to stroke patients in a network of collaborating hospitals. The resulting multi-level analysis contributes to understanding the innovation by revealing a highly complex process of interactions between key stakeholders and healthcare industry infrastructure. Despite the innovation's strong potential, the process is mainly push-driven with minimal pull from potential adopters. Moreover, the push is created by a small group of medical innovators with limited technological and financial resources and little infrastructural support. The study contributes with contextual insights into the telehealth innovation, suggesting complementary explanations of why the healthcare industry despite considerable investments continues to lag behind other industries in adoption of IT-based innovations. The study also adapts Van de Ven's framework by applying it to a single case of innovation rather than as originally conceived to several instances of an innovation within an industry. The analysis shows how some of the components of the framework were adapted to and interpreted in the context of telehealth innovations. © 2007 Operational Research Society Ltd. All rights reserved."

The study develops a theoretical framework that integrates elements of social actor theory (Lamb & Kling, 2003) to provide a more fine-grained analysis concentrating on the relationships among the radiology practitioners, the technology (an enterprise-wide Health Information System), and a larger social milieu surrounding its use.

It argues that a full understanding of the process of implementation of such systems should include not only technical aspects but also the social dynamics of an organization; specifically core values, distribution of power and mechanisms of control. A theoretical framework is formulated based on punctuated equilibrium and previous SIS literature, and is applied to an exploratory case study conducted in a Latin American public organization. The case study depicts how the initiative to implement SIS was the result of external and internal disturbances. The case analysis highlights relationships between an organization's deep structure and SIS implementation. The paper concludes by discussing the theoretical and practical implications of the study. These include (1) the role of the formal organizational structure in influencing the outcome of SIS implementations, (2) the impact of exogenous contingencies such as elections and external funding that may create a sense of crisis and (3) the influence of newcomers who may be brought in to solve the crisis."

The system was designed by a European consortium led by a Spanish polytechnic in cooperation with two universities in Lima and the Peruvian Ministry of Health. The purpose of the system was to improve health conditions by extending science-based medicine into a region with well-established traditional healing practices. The central analytical focus of this article is on the interplay between the public health care system, which used the telemedicine system, and local health care practices. The manner in which scientific medicine was delivered through information technology and public health care services is analyzed in terms of the health personnel's activity, the local population 's conceptions of health, and the trajectories followed by patients seeking recovery. The author participated in the design of the second evaluation of the telemedicine system and acted as a participant observer in the regional hospital and peripheral clinics. In addition to interviewing health care staff from the study area, the author also met with traditional healers, and patients in the districts whether or not they were involved in the telemedicine project. New institutional theory provided the analytical framework for the interpretation of the observed behavior of the public health care staff, traditional healers, and potential patients. Empirically, this study describes the informal aspects of the functioning of the telemedicine system, and its partial mismatch with the definitions of health and illness employed by local communities and healers. An argument is made that people's construction of their health, which is embedded in their normal patterns of action, should be identified, and then considered in the design, implementation, and evaluation of future telemedicine projects. This article problematizes an approach to telemedicine-based health development that is weakly accountable to local social contexts and their diversity."

In this article, we propose a strategy for developing information infrastructures in general and in particular for the health care sector in developing countries. We use complexity science to explain the challenges that need to be addressed, in particular the need for standards that can adapt to a changing health care environment, and propose the concept of flexible standards as a key element in a sustainable infra-structure development strategy. Drawing on case material from a number a/developing countries, a case is built around the use of flexible standards as attractors, arguing that if they are well defined and simple, they will be able to adapt to the frequent changes that are experienced in the complex health environment. A number of paradoxes are highlighted as useful strategies, integrated independence being one that encourages experimentation and heterogeneity to develop and share innovative solutions while still conforming to simple standards. The article provides theoretical concepts to support standardization processes in complex systems, and to suggest an approach to implement health standards in developing country settings that is sensitive to the local context, allows change to occur through small steps, and provides a mechanism for scaling information systems."

This is especially true in health care and national security, where this data is considered vital for a number of public health and safety initiatives. In some cases legislation has been used to establish some standards for limiting the collection of and access to such data. However, all such legislative efforts contain many provisions that allow for access to individually identifiable microdata without the consent of the data subject. Furthermore, although legislation is useful in that penalties are levied for violating the law, these penalties occur after an individual's privacy has been compromised. Such deterrent measures can only serve as disincentives and offer no true protection. This paper considers security issues involved in releasing microdata, including individual identifiers. The threats to the confidentiality of the data subjects come from the users possessing statistical information that relates the revealed microdata to suppressed confidential information. The general strategy is to recode the initial data, in which some subjects are ""safe"" and some are at risk, into a data set in which no subjects are at risk. We develop a technique that enables the release of individually identifiable microdata in a manner that maximizes the utility of the released data while providing preventive protection of confidential data.

We derive and propose a structured method to model how actors might be identified: structured because such a rationale is explicable and such a method is more readily usable when transferred to others. Our structured method, named IGOHcaps, uses a static and then a dynamic step to pull out the individual, group, organisational and human determinants of the critical actors. In this process, the individual actors' differing views emerge which could enable decision-making bodies to produce more robust proposals if they incorporated some of the appropriate views. We discuss the application of IGOHcaps through a hospital case study.

In this paper, we investigate how extra-organizational influences can impact user satisfaction with mobile systems. The findings from our longitudinal study highlight the interrelatedness of different use contexts and their importance in perceptions of user satisfaction. The data indicate that varying social contexts of individual use (individual as employee, as professional, as private user, and as member of society) result in different social influences that affect the individual's perceptions of user satisfaction with the mobile technology. While existing theories explain user satisfaction with IT within the organizational context, our findings suggest that future studies of mobile IT in organizations should accommodate such extra-organizational contextual influences.© 2006 Operational Research Society Ltd.

This paper presents an empirical study that examines the extent to which IT impacts customer service. More specifically, this study investigates the differential effects of various IT resources and capabilities on the performance of the customer service process across firms that compete in the North American life and health insurance industry. The paper builds on (1) information systems work that suggests that the effects of IT are best documented at the level of processes within a firm, (2) information systems work that suggests that the performance effects of IT are likely to be contingent in nature, and (3) developments in the resource-based view, which describes the kinds of IT resources and capabilities that are likely to enable a process in one firm to outperform the same process in competing firms. The findings suggest that tacit, socially complex, firm-specific resources explain variation in process performance across firms and that IT resources and capabilities without these attributes do not. Of particular interest to IS scholars, it is found that shared knowledge between IT and customer service units - an important driver of how IT is implemented and used in the customer service process - is a key IT capability that affects customer service process performance and moderates the impacts of explicit IT resources such as the generic information technologies used in the process and IT spending, which - consistent with resource-based predictions - were not found to be directly and positively associated with relative process performance. The implications of the findings for research and practice are discussed."

A review of the literature in these areas indicates that there is little agreement on the essential role of evaluation, a 'best way' to evaluate, on what and how to evaluate, whom to involve and within what paradigm to proceed. Reflecting on discussion within both traditions, this paper develops an approach to evaluation broadly based on critical theory, and argues that such an approach, while not offering a solution to all the problems of evaluation, does bring into focus fundamental questions relating to evaluation process and content. To illustrate this, the paper reflects on the strengths and weaknesses of an evaluation of a primary care intranet, and suggests how a critical approach might lead to a more meaningful evaluation and provide more significant and useful findings. © 2005 Operational Research Society Ltd.

Consequently, the outcomes of these design measures are evaluated. The evaluation results show that supporting trust can be achieved following a two-step model. The presented components support the perceived competence and perceived goodwill of the operators and the other members. Perceived goodwill and competence then support the process of creating and sustaining trust between members as well as between members and the operators of the VC and contribute to the successful implementation and maintenance of the community.

However, doctors were not the passive subjects of a computerized control system, and some were able to resist the application of the information produced by challenging its validity or using it to argue for more resources. Nevertheless, the interrelatedness of the information system with the organizational forms and practices within which it was used and which it helped shape reinforced the concepts, norms and values associated with the new management and economic discourse prevalent in the hospital, and helped to produce more defined accountabilities for doctors. With time, the role of the information system was reinterpreted, and in the face of continued resistance by doctors, it was relegated to a less significant role. The potential for engendering self-disciplining behaviour in organizational participants through the pervasive, everyday use of the information the system produced likewise diminished."

Findings from a study of 10 operational telemedicine projects in health care delivery systems are presented. The results presented here confirm, extend, and apparently contradict prior studies of interpersonal trust. Four types of interpersonal trust - calculative, competence, relational, and integrated - are identified and operationalized as a single construct. We found support for an association between calculative, competence, and relational interpersonal trust and performance. Our finding of a positive association between integrated interpersonal trust and performance not only yields the strongest support for a relationship between trust and VCR performance but also contradicts prior research. Our findings indicate that the different types of trust are interrelated in that positive assessments of all three types of trust are necessary if VCRs are to have strongly positive performance. The study also established that if any one type of trust is negative, then it is very likely that VCR performance will not be positive. Our findings indicate that integrated types of interpersonal trust are interdependent, and the various patterns of interaction among them are such that they are mutually reinforcing. These interrelationships and interdependencies of the different types of interpersonal trust must be taken into account by researchers as they attempt to understand the impact of trust on virtual collaborative relationship performance."

We approach this question, the problem of sustainability, building on a perspective on action research identifying the pivotal importance of networks. More precisely, local action research interventions need to be conceptualized and approached as but one element in a larger network of action in order to ensure sustainability. A vital aspect of our perspective is that local interventions depend heavily on the support of similar action research efforts in other locations. This is essential for the necessary processes of learning and experience sharing. We suggest that the scaling (i.e., spreading) of intervention is a prerequisite, not a luxury, for sustainable action research. Empirically, we base our analysis on an ongoing, large-scale action research project within the health care sector (called HISP) in a number of developing countries. HISP provides a fruitful occasion to investigate key criteria for our approach to action research, namely sustainability, scalability, and capacity to be politically relevant to the participants. We contribute to three discourses: (1) models of action research, (2) lessons for health information systems in developing countries, and (3) more generally, IS implementations that are dispersed, large-scale, and have scarce resources."

Theoretical perspectives such as informating and agency theory describe situations whereby legitimized management authority can control goal divergence by implementing information systems to better monitor agents' behavior and outcomes. But what happens when the principal does not possess legitimacy to impose an agent's use of information and/or behavioral conformance? This study investigates this situation. Through an action research project, a physicians' profiling system (PPS) was used to monitor and benchmark physicians' clinical practices and outcomes resulting in changed practice behaviors in closer congruence with management's goals. The PPS project represents a successful attempt of a hospital's management (principal) to ""informate the clan"" of physicians (agents) to reduce clinical procedural costs and adopt practices benchmarked to produce better outcomes. This research moves beyond directly controlling informated workers through legitimized managerial authority to a better understanding of how to informate autonomous professionals. Emerging insights suggest that a clan can be informated if the principal can improve the perceived legitimacy of the information (the message), legitimize the technical messenger (customized user interface), legitimize the human messenger (boundary spanners and influential clan members), and facilitate an environment where clan-based discussion, using the information provided by the principal, is incorporated into the process of concertive control."

As the term trust is often used in the context of individual interaction, at a group level we propose using the term health to measure the sustained competitive advantages of honest members over cheaters throughout the evolution of a community. We find conditions under which an electronic community is healthy and attracts outside population. We find that many factors, such as information dissemination speed, honest players' payoffs and possible losses, new community members' initial trust status, and the replacement rate of community members, all affect the health of an electronic community, and that some of them also affect a community's size.

While the results of a previous study indicate that IT investments have a positive but uniform impact on productivity, our study suggests that the impact of IT on productivity is not uniform but is contingent on other complementary factors. Our findings describe that the complementary relationship exists between IT and non-IT related investments. Thus, improved organizational productivity cannot be expected from investment in IT alone but only together with non-IT investments. Our findings also point out that further investment may not necessarily bring on higher organizational productivity."

Specifically, we compare 23 single models and bootstrap aggregating (i.e., bagging) models for their predictive abilities across five diverse medical data sets. We are able to reach important conclusions about our research objectives. Ensembles are more accurate than single models in their predictive ability. The best ensemble model achieves an error level significantly lower than the error of the best single model for four of the five medical applications analyzed. The magnitude of the error reduction ranges from 6.4% to 17.5%. Also, when designing an ensemble for an MDSS, the decision to diversify the model selection should be guided by the relationship between model instability and generalization error for the population of models under consideration. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Comprehensive Assessment for Tracking Community Health (CATCH) provides systematic methods for community-level assessment that is invaluable for resource allocation and health care policy formulation. CATCH is based on health status indicators from multiple data sources, using an innovative comparative framework and weighted evaluation process to produce a rank-ordered list of critical community health care challenges. The community-level focus is intended to empower local decision-makers by providing a clear methodology for organizing and interpreting relevant health care data. Extensive field experience with the CATCH methods, in combination with expertise in data warehousing technology, has led to an innovative application of information technology in the health care arena. The data warehouse allows a core set of reports to be produced at a reasonable cost for community use. In addition, online analytic processing (OLAP) functionality can be used to gain a deeper understanding of specific health care issues. The data warehouse in conjunction with Web-enabled dissemination methods allows the information to be presented in a variety of formats and to be distributed more widely in the decision-making community. In this paper, we focus on the technical challenges of designing and implementing an effective data warehouse for health care information.

Drawing on recent debates concerning knowledge and identity within social anthropology, IS and social psychology, this approach derives from a theoretical position which acknowledges social constraints on individual behaviour whilst according primacy to individuals' biographically determined interpretive work. Use of this approach in the field revealed layers of interpretive interaction between users and technology which had hitherto remained invisible and problematic, and allowed several simple practical interventions which strengthened the ability of users to generate their own meanings at critical junctures in the system.

In a typical professional setting, the essential characteristics of user, technology, and context may differ considerably from those in ordinary business settings. This study examined physicians' acceptance of telemedicine technology. Following a theory comparison approach, it evaluated the extent to which prevailing intention-based models, including the technology acceptance model (TAM), the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and an integrated model, could explain individual physicians' technology acceptance decisions. Based on responses from more than 400 physicians, both models were evaluated in terms of overall fit, explanatory power, and their causal links. Overall, findings suggest that TAM may be more appropriate than TPB for examining technology acceptance by individual professionals and that the integrated model, although more fully depicting physicians' technology acceptance, may not provide significant additional explanatory power. Also, instruments developed and repeatedly tested in prior studies involving conventional end-users and business managers may not be valid in professional settings.

Managed care seeks to integrate healthcare delivery processes and continuously improve them through feedback based on evaluation of care outcomes. The success of managed care depends critically on the collection, analysis and seamless exchange of information within and across organizational borders. This paper examines the business processes unique to managed care, and identifies its architecture requirements. We find that in addition to interorganizational networking, the architecture must provide sophisticated decision support capabilities. Historically, the emphasis of decision support in healthcare has been on clinical applications. Our examination shows that in the new managed care environment, it is equally important to also provide decision support for (i) specific nonclinical aspects of care delivery (ii) outcome analysis and (iii) continual refinement of care protocols to enhance cost-effectiveness."

This offers a unique setting to study the effect of regulation on the performance of the entire hospital and also of each input factor used in the production of services in the hospital. The cost function approach and the panel data technique allow us to test various hypotheses regarding technical change, substitution, and complementarity effects between IT investments, medical capital investments and labor expenses, and the role of regulation on the cost structure of hospitals.

Organizations continue to question the benefits from IT investments especially in conjunction with corporate initiatives such as business process reengineering (BPR). Furthermore, the impact of technology on nonfinancial outcomes such as customer satisfaction and quality is gaining interest. However, studies examining the IT-performance relationship have been far from conclusive. The difficulty in identifying impacts from technology has been the isolation of benefits of IT from other factors that may also contribute to organizational performance. Furthermore, benefits from technology investments may be realized over an extended period of time. Finally, IT benefits may accrue when they are done in concert with other organizational initiatives such as business process reengineering. This calls for studies that take into account control variables as well as data that span time per iods. In this study, we examine monthly data collected from eight hospitals over a recent three-year time period. We specify propositions that relate investments in IT to performance, and the combined effect of technology and BPR on performance. We draw upon the literature in health-care management to incorporate appropriate control variables in the analyses. Our results provide support for the IT-performance relationship that is observed after certain time lags. Such a relationship may not be evident in cross-sectional or snapshot data analyses. Also, results indicate support for the impact of technology contingent on BPR practiced by hospitals."

We distinguish between two integration concepts, including the integration between the EDI systems and internal systems (interface integration), and the integration among the internal systems (internal integration). Based on theory and literature, we propose that interface integration is favorably related to performance outcomes, and that interface integration and internal integration are positively related. Using data from the Group Insurance industry, we obtain supportive findings. We conclude that tactical EDI planning should centrally focus on interface integration regardless of how intensively management plans to use EDI. We further conclude that management may want to consider internal integration as a risk factor during EDI implementation, because the ability to establish high interface integration may be inhibited or advanced by low or high internal integration, respectively."

This paper presents findings from a study which investigated the influence of several factors on the social dimension of alignment within 10 business units in the Canadian life insurance industry. The social dimension of alignment refers to the state in which business and IT executives understand and are committed to the business and IT mission, objectives, and plans. The research model included four factors that would potentially influence alignment: (1) shared domain knowledge between business and IT executives, (2) IT implementation success, (3) communication between business and IT executives, and (4) connections between business and IT planning processes. The outcome, alignment, was operationalized in two ways: the degree of mutual understanding of current objectives (short-term alignment) and the congruence of IT vision (long-term alignment) between business and IT executives. A total of 57 semi-structured interviews were held with 45 informants. Written business and IT strategic plans, minutes from IT steering committee meetings, and other strategy documents were collected and analyzed from each of the 10 business units. All four factors in the model (shared domain knowledge, IT implementation success, communication between business and IT executives, and connections between business and IT planning) were found to influence short-term alignment. Only shared domain knowledge was found to influence long-term alignment. A new factor, strategic business plans, was found to influence both short and long-term alignment. The findings suggest that both practitioners and researchers should direct significant effort toward understanding shared domain knowledge, the factor which had the strongest influence on the alignment between IT and business executives. There is also a call for further research into the creation of an IT vision."

In response, this paper reports a research work that examined the applicability of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) in explaining physicians' decisions to accept telemedicine technology in the health-care context. The technology, the user group, and the organizational context are all new to IT acceptance/adoption research. The study also addressed a pragmatic technology management need resulting from millions of dollars invested by healthcare organizations in developing and implementing telemedicine programs in recent years. The model's overall fit, explanatory power, and the individual causal links that it postulates were evaluated by examining the acceptance of telemedicine technology among physicians practicing at public tertiary hospitals in Hong Kong. Our results suggested that TAM was able to provide a reasonable depiction of physicians' intention to use telemedicine technology. Perceived usefulness was found to be a significant determinant of attitude and intention but perceived ease of use was not. The relatively low R-square of the model suggests both the limitations of the parsimonious model and the need for incorporating additional factors or integrating with other IT acceptance models in order to improve its specificity and explanatory utility in a health-care context. Based on the study findings, implications for user technology acceptance research and telemedicine management are discussed."

The ""Health Grid"" is introduced as a way of representing the IS applications portfolio in order to facilitate the assessment and interpretation of its health. One of the advantages of using the grid is to make such an assessment explicit, transparent, and discussible. In an example, the Health Grid is used to assess and interpret the IS applications portfolio of the most profitable business unit in a large process manufacturing firm. The applications portfolio, consisting of 18 systems, was generally assessed as requiring attention. For example, there was no evidence of any relationship between the investment in a given system and its management value.

By studying the process of aligning and linking one inscription to other inscriptions, we also hope to learn more about the strength of inscriptions, that is, the degree to which an inscription actually succeeds in enforcing a desired behaviour. The empirical basis of our analysis is a case-study of standardization processes of health information infrastructure from Norway. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd."

The Scottish Health Service's central provider of IT services - the Common Services Agency (CSA) - attempted to develop a coherent EDI strategy, which would also have supported its role in the organisational status quo. However, the very weakness of its organisational power base which it sought to bolster in this way meant that the EDI strategy did not proceed rapidly or smoothly, and this then provided the opportunity for supplier companies to advance their own strategic aims through the implementation of proprietary EDI systems. The case study thus raises doubts about the extent to which EDI can be promoted and guided by public administration. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V."

When consumers differ significantly in terms of their riskiness, and their insurance companies cannot, or are not permitted to assess these differences, insurance companies will attempt to charge all consumers the same premiums for equivalent coverage; unless mechanisms can be designed to allow consumers to signal accurately and credibly their private assessments of their own riskiness, low-risk consumers will consider that they are being overcharged and many will drop out of the market. These consumers, who wish to buy insurance - albeit at a lower price - but who are not now insured, represent a loss of social welfare. As information asymmetries increase, more consumers determine that they are being overcharged, increasing the loss of social welfare. This paper addresses minimizing the loss of social welfare, or maximizing the extent to which the population is insured, in the presence of extremely different consumer risk profiles by examining plausible pricing and policy designs, in order to assess which design minimizes decreases in consumer participation in the insurance market. While unable to make selections among information regimes, which entail a wide range of complex and subjective social choices, the paper does make clear comparisons of alternative designs within each information regime."

Collaborative advantage is defined as the benefit gained by a group of participants as the result of their cooperation rather than their competition. The development of a community health information network by seven competing hospitals in Dayton, Ohio illustrates how information technology can provide such an advantage. It also provides lessons for information systems and other managers who might consider such a use of information technology for their organization. Finally, it suggests further research on the subject."

Conventional hospital information systems help meet the challenge by providing data necessary for policy formation and outcome measurement. Additional decision support systems deliver models that can be used to systematically evaluate the policies. When deployed successfully, each stand-alone system can effectively support a segment of the hospital decision making process. Integrating the stand-alone functions can enhance the quality and efficiency of the segmented support, create synergistic effects, and augment decision making performance and value. A high-level integration framework, known as the management support system (MSS), can be adapted to provide the desired synthesis. This paper demonstrates how management support systems can improve hospital decision making. It overviews the hospital decision making process, presents an MSS for supporting this process, and measures the impact of the MSS on the process and outcomes of decision making. The paper also examines the implications of the analyses for information systems research and health care practice."

Reorganization of the UK primary health care system to create an internal market for health services depends upon local family doctors (general practitioners) taking on budgetary responsibilities and purchasing services from hospitals. These budgets will be monitored by local committees. The success of the internal market is heavily dependent upon computerized management information systems.

In fact, knowledge acquisition has often been cited as being the bottleneck to successful development efforts. Unfortunately, other than normative viewpoints, little attention has been paid to the behavioral and interpersonal skill set and related training of knowledge engineers, especially as pertains to the knowledge acquisition process. This study surveyed 101 persons who are, or have been, actively engaged in knowledge acquisition activities; the intent was to determine their interpersonal skills training, to ascertain their perceptions of how important many behavioral and interpersonal skills are for knowledge acquisition, and to determine how proficient knowledge engineers believe they are in terms of these skills and traits. Results indicate only minimal training in most interpersonal skills. In addition, the results showed that knowledge engineers generally feel less qualified in many of the more important skills, possibly as a result of the lack of effective education and training. © 1994."

A rather eclectic literature search reveals that while hundreds of applied expert systems have been prototyped, these have not led to a groundswell of interest among either practicing physicians or healthcare administrators. To account for this apparent failure of expert systems to deliver on their promised capabilities, three key factors are explored: physician disinterest' the low priority assigned to Al among healthcare information systems executives; and the relatively new competitive market pressures affecting health services delivery. A domain of the healthcare industry where ES and knowledge-based technology has taken hold, i.e. the managed care/utilization review arena, is described. This new application of ES technology has the potential to influence standards of medical practice through ""medical necessity criteria"" embedded in the knowledge base, and to disseminate key findings from research on medical treatment outcomes. Ethical and legal issues sorrounding the appropriate use of this technology remain as yet untested and unresolved, however. © 1992."

Three propositions are developed from (1) re-examining a variety of successful IST applications both within and outside healthcare organizations, (2) re-applying the integration concept from the literature, and (3) examining field experiences in the healthcare industry. These propositions should serve as a basis for future empirical investigations into IST strategic applications."

The present study investigated the stress, work attitudes, and health behaviors of 446 information systems personnel employed in 18 different organizations. Type A behavior pattern was found to be a significant moderator for some of the stressor-criterion associations. The findings suggest that more managerial understanding of person-environment fit in general and the individual employee's predisposition toward the Type A behavior pattern specifically may be beneficial in attempting to initiate, nurture, and sustain a productive and healthy work atmosphere. © 1985."

This paper describes how STRuctured OBservation of the Environment (STROBE) was used to aid in determining the information requirements of a regional blood service organization.

It is conceptualized by drawing a parallel between the concrete and abstract elements in a film, and similar elements found in an organization.
